AskCulinary,"I have only recently started regularly making pan sauces after searing a protein. I'm enjoying them, but hoping to diversify my repertoire so it does not get monotonous.   Typically I sweat a shallot, sometimes with mushrooms, sometimes garlic, deglaze with dry white wine, reduce. Sometimes then add some stock (actually Better Than Bouillon; I have been meaning to get to the local bulk foods store to buy some unflavored gelatin to add to it) and reduce again. Then usually stir in some dijon, and finish either with butter or a little full fat Greek yogurt thinned with water (I do not keep cream, and this simulates it just fine in every application I have tried it in). Sometimes I'll add capers if the protein is seafood, and a squeeze of lime if I want it brighter after tasting for seasoning.  Any ideas to switch this up would be appreciated.

If I grind the frozen pulp it also ferments well (frozen fruits release more juice as ice crystals break the cell membranes). But if I add frozen zest all fermenting activity is inhibited and the brew just gets spoiled and sour in few days.

I have always been too food-safe concerned to try with raw egg, and after getting a sous vide for Christmas I decided to try a Hugh Acheson recipe for Mayo.

It turned out alright, but the consistency was more like ketchup or mustard rather than the bottled mayo, I couldn’t get it to form peaks.  Thoughts on how to thicken it more?

AskCulinary,I have been experimenting with Chinese steamed black bean ribs (the type you get at dim sum).   Some of the recipes recommend running the ribs under the faucet until they are pale to both tenderize the ribs and also get rid of the blood.   Couple questions about this: - alternate methods. Looking for other methods as it takes time and lots of water - I’m individually rinsing each riblet for at least   seconds. Would soaking the ribs in cold water draw the blood out?  What about taking a hand torch to the ends of the ribs - seems like the blood leeches out of there so could burning it seal the blood in?    - what if I do not do this?  I did notice that some blood still leaked out during cooking and it just coagulated at the end of the bone. Yeah it’s ugly and I just scraped it to the side. I could imagine if I had a sauce I wouldn’t want blood blobs floating it in - but is this just a cosmetic thing or would excess blood impact taste?

Three days ago I made him a batch with ground turkey ground beef sweet potatoes navy beans red beans along with dark red beans peas carrots kale broccoli cauliflower and black beans. I cooked it until it boiled as I do as usual. I let it cool until it hit approximately  °. I needed to go to work so I went ahead and put the entire batch into the refrigerator. When I got home at lunch to feed him I took it out it was bubbling and stunk to high heaven. I love my dog deeply and I have never ever had this incident before. Oh by the way there was also brown rice in his batch of food. So it was bubbling and as I said it's stunk. I thought for sure it must have been the turkey. So I took everything washed with the UPC back to the store I rebought everything and wouldn't you know it it happened again. The only thing that I am doing different is because I'm working so many hours I'm using canned beans.

Please help me what am I doing wrong?

I do not know what to do. Please please tell me what I'm doing wrong is it the canned beans? Should I immediately put it in the refrigerator which I have never done I'm confused. And Sam's hungry.

AskCulinary,"What's the best way to finish this prime rib roast?  So this morning my grandma started cooking our   standing rib roast. The recipe she was following (which is for a   roast) called for it to be cooked at  °f for     hours. At that point it should be removed, coated with a mustard mixture and then cooked for another   hour.  Due to circumstances the roast was cooked for the first     hours, coated and then placed in the oven with the heat off.  This was all before   and the roast has been sitting in the oven ever since, it still hasn't completely cooled.  So what's the best way to finish it off?

AskCulinary,"Hi - I'm making gummy bears for my dog but they get moldy without being in the fridge. I'm trying to avoid potassium sorbate and citric acid to make them as clean as possible, but still shelf stable. I recently read you can use lemon / lime juice as a natural preservative... Will that work? How much would I need?   Here's the recipe I'm using:     cup cool water (or alternative dog-friendly liquid of your preference)    tbsp quality powdered gelatin    tbsp smooth beaut butter    tbsp boiling hot water  Making the Treats: Measure the water into a small pan. Sprinkle the surface with gelatin powder. Wait and let sit for approximately five minutes or longer for the gelatin powder to bloom / gel.  Gently stir the mixture over low heat until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Take care not to shortcut with high temperatures or overheat. Heat can reduce the setting strength of gelatin.    Remove from heat.  Measure your peanut butter into a suitable container for mixing and pouring. I have tried a variety of methods over the years, but nowadays, I like using a coffee milk jug when I make gummies. Incrementally add small amounts of boiling hot water to the peanut butter, stirring it into the peanut butter until it melts together. Add your warm prepared gelatin to the melted peanut butter mixture and stir to thoroughly combine. Optional: To help avoid any lingering bits from settling and making it difficult to cleanly separate the gummies from the molds, you can allow the mixture to cool to just above its setting point before pouring into the moulds. Slowly, stirring often, allow the mixture to cool and thicken. You can do this at room temperature, or speed it up by using the fridge or an ice bath, if you prefer. When the mixture has thickened enough, spoon/pour the finished gelatin mixture into a glass pan (cut and slice) or silicone moulds (shapes). Chill to set.

AskCulinary,"I'm experimenting with creating a mochi-like sweet without sweet gluttonous rice flour. I want that chewy soft doughy consistency. If I make regular dough from all purpose flour, that makes the right chewiness and softness. And if I heat up the flour before adding water it should kill all the bad germs, so eating the dough should be safe. But that feels a little like cheating.  I have messed with butter and coconut oil and adding too much of fat to flour ratio makes baking them turn out like buttery flour sand cookies. Adding too little turns them into hard rocks of solid bread. Undercooking the dough makes the outside crunchy and the inside chewy dough. I have experimented with eggs and cornstarch as binders, but I do not think I have come up with the right ratio to really make a different. Adding too much eggs makes it into a cake like bread. Adding even more egg makes german pancakes (custard like). Adding too much wheat gluten makes it chewy and tough with a strange almost bitter taste.  Is there a combination of all purpose flour, and other common ingredients, kneading / no kneading, steaming, microwave, convection oven, or other techniques or equipment.

Then my second question is, for smoking, should I trim the fat or not? I have read conflicting reports, some people say to trim the fat because it will prevent the flavors of the smoke from penetrating the meat, others say to leave it on as a protective layer to prevent the meat from drying out. My goal for the smoked brisket is to half a juicy and tender falling apart brisket so I want this to be as moist as possible.

AskCulinary,"tl;dr: I tried to make [Serious Eats' NY pizza dough (recipe)](  the other day, but it turned out way too sticky. Trying to understand what happened.  Like the recipe says, I added the dry ingredients (flour was  % protein manitoba) to my food processor (Magimix  , dough blade installed), pulsed to mix, added warm water and oil and ran the food processor for  -  minutes to incorporate. During that time, my food processor was struggling to mix and even got stuck once, but then suddenly got unstuck and easily worked through the whole dough which in the end was very soft, gooey and sticky and didn't ball up like in the recipe. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried to do the windowpane test, but it was tearing really easily, no success.  The dry ingredients alone already filled up the food processor to about two thirds capacity, so I'm sure I just overloaded it. I'd like to understand what might have happened though: Did the dough blade, due to lack of space, instead of kneading, cut through the dough and rupture the gluten? Also, I didn't measure my water temp, could it have been too warm? It definitely wasn't hot, I'd guess in the range of  -  ( - ).

Today, once the tuna was completely defrosted sometime around noon, I marinated it and put it back in the fridge while I prepped side dishes (about   minutes). Then I served and we ate.   Was this process considered correct or should I have done something differently?

The next problem is, that I only have a cast iron skillet for   steaks at a time and I am afraid that the parts from the middle will be too wet to sear properly and the   batch may cool down too much while the   batch cooks. I would baste it in garlic and thyme butter etc. all the good stuff.  The meat right now is in the shape of about   if it makes any difference.

I realize it’s probably to soften the peel but it seems like you’d lose a lot of the flavor, or at least the nuance of the flavor. How do you not just end up with sweet and bland gummy sticks?   Also, I found a recipe that simply mixes fresh zest in granulated sugar, which can be kept in an airtight jar (and sprinkled on toast, for example).

AskCulinary,"Since this is my first post I figured I’d let you know a little about myself. I’m a   year old man living in NEPA (northeast Pennsylvania) currently working as a cook at a small local restaurant. I am a knowledgeable cook in the kitchen, and always looking to expand my knowledge base. I am not professionally trained, however, I have worked in many different types of restaurants (larger chain, mom/pop, mid level all from scratch). I love to cook and am finally realizing it’s probably the only thing I enjoy enough to not hate every day. There’s a little about me but onto the current situation.   Currently, I am in is I am the lead line cook along with the owner of the restaurant. There is a couple people who work up front but that’s about it. He has a successful food truck and the restaurant he bought and converted was doing good before the pandemic hit. His menu is basic food truck type items: cheesesteak, fries, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I have been here for about two months, things are slow but we are making it work. I have implemented certain things to make quality better (shredding our own cheese, making prep sheets, helping improve current recipes). The restaurant we have used to be a pizza shop and the ovens came with the building, two stacked Zesto deck ovens. I said I love making pizza dough and we can experiment. I made the pizza, we now serve it Friday and Saturday nights in very limited quantities. (  dough balls combined for both days). If you are curious about the pizza just let me know!  Since the holidays are coming up I am going to experiment with making a fried chicken sandwich that we can start as a special but hopefully be a new menu item, possibly the start to a menu change. Currently the chicken we use for the flat top is just chicken breasts sliced super thin. I was thinking of taking these same chicken breasts and possibly splitting/slicing portions into either halves or slicing into make shift tenders or both. My thought process is a fried chicken sandwich like Popeyes or chick-fil-a with the split breasts on a burger bun and then a tender type sandwich on Texas toast, similar to something you get at zaxbys and Rasin canes. I am going to brine in seasoned buttermilk for at least a day, now comes the part where I need some advice. We only have one fryer at the moment and limited space so hand battering might become difficult if higher volumes are achieved. Also, it’s an open fryer and not a pressure fryer, but I still want the most crisp and juicy chicken I can get. So for prep I was thinking of dredging all the chicken, frying once at a lower temperature  - . Draining them very well then either refrigerate or freeze them and fry at high temp  -  for service. This I feel like would cut down on ticket time and also produce juicy and crispy chicken.   Please let me know any in insight or tips any of you have!

I live in Germany, and while this one butcher has good quality meat, this purchase was a nightmare. In Berlin, people often point blank refuse to speak German with you if they get even a hint that it's not your main language. Problem is, they often do not speak English as well as they think. Case in point: he was convinced ""braise"" means ""roast"". And his French colleague falsely said UK and US cuts of beef are the same, then recommended a cut of beef called... ""roast beef.""  So my problem is: I want to make a roast, but their advice was not useful or relevant ; I couldn't do much research online as the US/UK cuts are not available here; and the info that's online German is for German recipes, which are not what I want to cook. (They're great, but this is xmas, and it's about tradition).  This cut was called the ""entrecôte"". Here's a link to the German wiki so you can see where it's cut from here: [  They said this cut would be good for ""short roast"" (he said this in German, ""Kurzbraten"", short as in time) and that it should be ""pink"".  What I'm looking for: I want to keep it medium rare and prevent it drying out, but that might be difficult as it does not have the layer of fat you get on a sirloin.

AskCulinary,"Hi all, I’m about to make the fish stick from Blumenthal’s Heston at Home cookbook. Every recipe I have made from here including three of his other stocks have been absurdly good, but this one is giving me some hesitancy. Mostly because it’s a fish stock made in a pressure cooker.  Basically you clean and lightly toast the fish bones (I’m using sea bass) and heads in a pan, then in the pressure cooker you sautéed a bunch of veggies (carrot celery onion fennel tomatoes mushrooms garlic). Then deglaze with white wine and vermouth until pretty much gone, add the bones and water and then pressure cook for   minutes. Let it cool before removing the lid and then briefly simmer it for about   minutes with an herb blend, fennel seeds, saffron, lemon peel strips, and mussels. Strain.  To me this all sounds wonderful but the pressure cooker makes it sound like it’ll give me an absurdly overly pungent overcooked fishy stock. Even Kenji on serious eats said he tried to pressure cook a fish stock for   minutes and it was incredibly unpleasant.  I trust Heston as he hasn’t done me wrong yet, but this idea goes against everything I have ever learned about cooking. What would you all do? The same thing he suggests but with a stove top simmer?

I do  % of the cooking and food preparation, and since quarantine, we have put on some pounds. I realize part of this is because I am really sick of eating what I fix and cooking certain things. I want to move our overall diet to healthier foods (not really to lose weight) but to be healthier in general. My five year old is very picky but I am hoping she would catch on.      We would eat a lot of potatoes, starchs, and some meats, and I would like to cut down on these things while still having a filling meal. I have never really cooked anything besides what you would call normal staples of food in certain areas (like mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets, etc) and want to really change our food entirely.      What cuisines should I look at? I am not the best cook, but I can follow directions. I was looking at Japanese cuisine since they do rice, and vegetables, but feel as if it's not sustainable and would be expensive, so I'm worried our grocery bill would skyrocket. That and it seems like it would take a very long time for each meal, which I'm not sure I have the time for. The same goes for a lot of healthier recipes I have found as far as pricing.

I understand the concept of adding baking soda to create a foaming effect and aerate the caramel (if you add enough you get honeycomb, etc.).  However, all recipes I have seen do this use some percentage of brown sugar in the caramel.

So... what is going on here?  People seem to say that a solution of white sugar in water might be slightly acidic, but it seems like not very acidic.  My only guess is that as the sugar decomposes during caramelization into all the flavorful compounds that make up caramel, some of these compounds are acid-forming.

AskCulinary,"Ho ho ho, fellow redditers,  My girlfriend and I have decided to each take upon us a Christmas dinner to cook for the other person. She'll be cooking on Christmas Eve and I will be on Christmas day.   At first, I just wanted to cook a starter, main and a dessert, but my stupid brain decided that I want to one-up her as I think she will be doing those three. I would like to also include a amuse and a entremets(?). She is also vegetarian and beets are by far her favorite vegetable, so I had the idea to make beets the central theme of this dinner. So far I have come up with this:  ***Amuse:***  Blini with cream cheese/goat cheese, pickled red/yellow beet and wasabi/horseradish.      ***Starter***:  A beet soup. She also loves soup, so this one is a no-brainer for me. I have found three recipes, which interest me:  [  \- Sounds and looks great;  [  \-  also sounds and looks great;  [  \-  I love the minimalistic look, but I'm afraid that it will be too heavy in the whole menu.  Can't really decide between these three and I'm unable to knowledgeably say what would fit best in terms of flavors and richness.  ***Inbetween/Entremet:***  I wanted to go for a salad and luckily my boy Kenji has this one covered. I'm planning on making this a small dose.  [   ***Main:***  A 'beet' Wellington has been something she has wanted to make/eat for a very long time, but somehow it never came to it. I kinda have to make this as a main, but was always a little bit intimidated as I was afraid to have the dough become watery and only being able to slice of a couple of good sliced from the middle parts of the beet. I came across this recipe though, which in my opinion eliminates both those issues:  [   At first I wanted to make the Australian Masterchef young prodigy child's beet wellington, but when I looked up the recipe I wanted to jump off a roof. It had like   steps and ingredients and techniques for which I do not even have the equipment. A no-go.   I have also come across Gordon Ramsey's beet wellington, and I think that I'm going no take his gel recipe and put the following things on it:  \- Pickled yellow beet;  \- Beet chips/crisps;  \- Truffle oil;  \- Microgreens (If I can find any);  \- Horseradish.  I have also seen lots of recipes put a layer of spinach around the beet, **does anyone know why and what it adds to the dish?** I do not really see the charm of it. And **would the douxel of Gordon Ramsey's regular Beef Wellington dish (the youtube-video) be a good replacement for the one from Lazycatkitchen, or would it mess up some things?**  **For the jus/sauce** I haven't really been able to decide what I'm going to make. I have found about  's sauces and jus' but I'm unsure what would taste good with this. **Help would be really appreciated!**  ***Dessert***:  This is where I'm struggling the most. **Would something like a chocolate lava cake with beet in it taste good?** Or maybe **the cake with some beetjuice salted caramel sauce?** I'm not sure if it would bring anything to the table or even color the cake or sauce red. The most common thing I have found which involved beets were cakes, but I do not want to make a whole damn cake.  Maybe this: [  ?

I learned early on that I hate speed work, but love the feeling after hard speed runs so that kept me motivated to keep hitting those hard runs as best I could. In week   of my training, I was near the end of my   mile long run when I tripped and scraped my hands and knees pretty badly. I jogged it out and vowed to be more careful on my runs to avoid tripping again.   weeks later, my knees were all healed up and I was doing a speed run in the dark and I tripped while on an especially dark part of the sidewalk, reopening my freshly healed knees. Luckily that was my last fall of training.   I had run a half-marathon prior to this with little training so I was unsure of what I was getting myself into with this, but I came out of training with a new love for running and new PRs for my  ,  , and half-marathons!  ### Pre-race  The days leading up to the race were busy but restful with it being Christmastime which was also favorable in terms of nutrition. I was able to get a good portion of carbs in throughout the days leading up to the race and took a short jog the day before to make sure my body was loosened up. The night before, I made sure my playlist was solid and I had my route memorized and went to bed fairly early feeling a bit anxious but ready for the race.  ### Race  I was hoping the forecast was wrong, but this ended up being my coldest run yet. Living in Florida, we do not get much cold weather, so a   start at  :  was definitely a shock to the system. I felt strong starting off from my house and a friend surprised me and showed up to run the first half with me. Going through downtown I was right on pace and crossing the first bridge, I had another friend surprise me to run with for the next   miles too.   Going through a neighborhood during mile  , I misstepped coming off the sidewalk and tweaked my knee which came back to hurt a lot later in the run.   I came back across the river and was surprised by a crowd of family and friends that my wife had organized to cheer me on throughout the second half of the marathon. As I passed the   mile point, my wife hopped on her bike to follow me and cheer me on as I went through the remainder of the race.  Around mile  , my knee started to hurt more from the tweak and so I had to slow down and walk for portions to give my knee a rest and stretch it as much as I could.   I felt great, albeit a little sore, moving past mile   and was ready to finish it. Around mile   my knee locked up for a second and I almost tripped and seriously thought about giving up for a minute, but as I walked through a corner I was greeted by cheering and my friend who had run a short part earlier came back to help me finish it off.   I felt strong crossing the last bridge and with a   mix of walking/running I was able to power through the finish line and complete my first marathon!  ### Post-race  I walked around and talked with everyone who had come to cheer me on (socially distanced of course) and drank a gatorade and water and ate a banana and muffin. The soreness in my knee didn't set it until that night, but icing it and moving on it has made the pain almost completely disappear! Overall, I'm much less sore than I expected to be, yet sore in places I didn't expect to be. I'm taking  -  weeks off for recovery, but I plan to train some more and focus on speed and get back out there to PR my marathon time sometime next year!

I think this pandemic and that run have been the absolute best thing that could have happened for me at that moment. All of that extra commute time and later in the day showering capability opened up my mornings to the sun rise runs. Being able to cook all of my meals on the spot brought back my cooking skills and creativity to manage my diet in better ways.

(feel free to skip these next   paragraphs):   In March of this year, I ran a   PR of  : , and a couple weeks later, I decided to run a half for the first time on my own. I started out pretty conservatively, and sped up throughout. I finished in  :  and was satisfied with how it went. I didn't really have any time goals, and was excited that I ran at an  :  pace per mile. In August, I wanted to get under  : , but I ran a  :  It was hot and even started thundering, and I drastically slowed down (almost walking) at mile   I knew the heat played a big role, and it was still a good time, but I was discouraged not to PR.  This fall, I had a good cross country season, even with the fewer meets due to COVID. I kept up my training during November/December, and felt motivated to run more. Recently, I started thinking about trying to time trial a half marathon again. In November, I ran a   time trial and got literally the same exact time ( : ), but I still was hopeful I could PR in the half. I set an ambitious goal of subbing  :  because then I would be averaging under   min/mile!  RACE REPORT: I worked out a race plan after googling and posting here on this sub reddit. Today, I pretty much followed the plan, and it actually went better than I thought. Mile   I ran in  : , and I took the next   or so miles pretty easy (miles       were had long gradual uphills). I felt good coming through the   in just under   minutes. (Original plan was to do roughly a    min    ,   min    , last   sprint). Mile   I felt really good! I had picked it up a bit, found a rhythm, and felt like picking it up more. Miles  -  were just under   minutes, and had some hills. Mile   was where I really felt the fatigue. I was panicking a bit because it didn't look like I would achieve my goal unless I picked it up. I got to mile   and continued to push. Once I hit mile  , I was in a lot of discomfort, desperately wanted to stop and just call it a tempo long run, but I tried to make it to  , then  , then the final sprint.

running,"Hii to all runners !!   I am indebted to this sub for helpful suggestions corresponding to running. I would like to share some lessons/experiences and hope they will prove helpful for  runners on this sub.  ) If you are beginner, donot be in hurry to speed up. Condition your body by doing slow continuous running for  -  months on soft surface. Once your body gets conditioned then sky is the limit.  ) During morning it is always advisable to work on stamina rather  than speed. Speed works require warm conditions. Try to schedule your speed works during day time or evening.  ) It is always advisable to break your practice/running sessions in two portions. Practicing/running twice a day always bring better results as compared to one hard session.  ) After hard training/running in morning, cat naps are powerful tool to rejuvinate your body and can prepare your body for evening sessions.  ) If you are doing road running then use spongy shoes with flexible soles to avoid injury.  ) If you want to run fast, then strength of legs has to be improved. The best way to improve leg strenth is  hill running. Runners living in planes can improve leg strength by running in sand strips(if any).  ) For long runs, road is always preferable to   metres track. Long runs on   track are very boring and  mentally tiring.  ) For long runs always try to make groups of enthusiastic runners. Long runs are more about mental strength than physical strength. It feels easy while running in groups.  ) As far as running posture is concerned you can bend your arms at   degree from elbows and keep your shoulders loose.    ) For fast recovery after runs, hydrate yourself and take proteins(from shakes or sprouted grains) within half an hour of completion of training session.  )  Avoid over loading your body. Its always ok to slow down or miss some training/sessions if you feel so. Some symptoms of overloading are reduced hunger, irritability, sleeplessness etc. Donot be too hard on yourself, always remind yourself that you have to turn up tommorrow as well.  ) Variation is the key to develope harmonious relationship with running. Try to spice up your running sessions with stamina sessions, speed sessions, ABC exercises, tempo runs, slow-fast sessions, hill running, sand running, power running etc.  ) Sleep is the best friend of the runners. Sound sleep in the night,catnaps,power naps etc. has potential to rejuvinate runners and can amplify their performance in the track.  ) Donot forget to stretch after running. Stretching and running are inseparable.   ) Hot water baths and diaphragmatic breathing( sudarshan kriya) go a long way in recovery after hard sessions.  ) Personally I feel its better to run empty stomach. If you run in the evening, atleast try to finish your lunch three hours before evening session. Having meal too close to your running sessions may cause flatulence and discomfort.",Running is not only sport but an art.

running,"Hello all  I'm trying to get a jumpstart on my   resolution of finally getting ""good"" at running (I have never been able to break a sub-    for the past TEN YEARS, but mainly because I have been lazy and not put enough effort into it)  I have noticed something odd about the way I run - my gait changes depending on how fast I go, and because of this, I find running at slightly higher speeds MUCH more difficult.   Is it normal for your ""gait"" to change as you get faster?

running,"A year go today I was reading this subreddit a few days out from the new year and mention came up of how novel the opportunity to run every day of a leap year was and that the chance was coming to hit that unique milestone.  I'm writing this now rather than in   days having completed the challenge as it took me a couple of days to psych myself up to the idea of the challenge and someone reading this might have just enough time to get their headspace right to take on   in a similar capacity.  My background as a runner is of one who would be at the tail end of the recreational runners doing a half marathon. I had never run a single km in my life until the novelty of the Nike+ running app on my first iPhone I got when I was   made me give it a go and a year later I ran my first half in a little over   hours (I'm   yrs now).  Last year I ran a total of   and actually didn't run a single day in the December leading in to this years challenge.  One of the biggest but possibly less obvious hurdles in completing a challenge such as running   days in a row is getting buy in and support from your family for the unforgiving time commitment involved, most days my run would take   minutes building up to get gear on,   minutes of running,   minutes of cooling down and   minutes for a shower afterwards.  That's an easy   minutes of disruption every day that I had to get past my wife, so for her understanding I am very appreciative of that.  I set my personal goal to run a minimum of   a day as I do not do miles and   didn't  sound like a real run while I felt I could do   in some capacity even  if under the weather.  I have averaged a little over   so far these  first   days of the year and look to pass the   mark on Thursday.  Running  while unwell I have been lucky to only have a serious cold/fever on two  occasions that I had to push through,   migraines that caused partial  vision issues were a little rougher to manage and I was able to rest a  few hours in a dark room first then make it out.  I fell on one night  time run grazing a knee and my hands but with no real damage and just  last week twisted my ankle tripping down the stairs in the dark but  managed to shake that one off too.  Mostly  I have run at night time, anywhere from  - .  My headlamp of choice  is a Black Diamond Sprinter as it has a blinking red light on the back  as well as full illumination upfront making me feel safer running on the  roads.  I have  found the tracking from the web app Smashrun which I got on to from the  posts I saw here last year fantastic motivation for maintaining the  streak and following my improvements.  This app imports runs I record  using my old Garmin FR   Sometimes  I'd run as many as   days in a row doing my bare minimum   as a bit  of a recovery from a more intense or disrupted period, other times It'd  be the other way around and I'd do   days of  + each day.  My biggest  month was October with   in the month.  Starting  out just seeing if I could do   days in a row then   was quite  exciting.  Knowing past that point it would be to throw away the streak  and have to start over has psychologically been the right fit for me  (and in the case of a leap year challenge in particular require a  +  year reset period).  I have had a history of calf and achilles injuries so I had to really listen to my body and ease down on the speed at the times I felt I was pushing my limits.  I feel that this years training has really built a resilience in both my body and mind which has been a great bonus to the whole endeavour.  My  first   of the year I had a pace of  :  per km with an average heart  rate of  , whereas yesterdays   I had a page of  :  per km and an  average heart rate of   which demonstrates I think some pretty solid  gains over the period.  I'll be the first to admit I'm a heavier runner  at  , I haven't focussed on diet this year to any great extent but  feel I can make some changes there too.  I did however manage to go the  whole year without alcohol or caffeine which may seem to some to be more  extreme than the running streak even.  TLDR;   I have found the goal of a running streak for a whole year to be  enjoyable and rewarding, but it is definitely a challenge that requires a commitment and compromises to make it work.  I'm going to see if I can carry the streak on to   days and beyond, but am considering the possibility of breaking it for a little balance and to take on some other goals while still running at least  + days a week.",Lessons learned from a year of running inspired by r/running,nbly,1609232013,2020-12-29 08:53:33,0

running,"This has been happening since I ran the   meters in   grade (intro to running) up until now (  grade), so I'm guessing it's normal? I have been to cardiologists just to be safe, and everything comes back perfectly fine, saying I have a very healthy heart. Eventually I concluded that this is normal with exertion, since it does not happen (or happens only slightly) during most of my easier/moderate runs. But I still have my doubts. I have googled, but none of the heart or lung conditions really fit what I experienced.   I do not have asthma, and this isn't really a breathing issue. Sure, I'm breathing heavily by the end of a race, but for me, it's the chest/lung discomfort that starts way before the leg discomfort. During the last mile of a   race, I feel this tight pain centered around my chest area that makes it increasingly harder to push through. Whether it be me pumping through the final stretch of a track workout, a  ,   or a steep hill, I always feel it. Hot or cold weather; does not matter. Feels the same. Even happens when I'm swimming, nordic ski racing, or biking (uphill usually) really intensely.   I'm pretty sure this is normal when athletes push themselves. I mean that's why nordic skiers collapse at the end of a race, right? What makes me frustrated, is that I have never been able to describe this pain/discomfort very well. Luckily, it does not seem to be accompanied by other symptoms. Well, actually, by the end of a hilly  , my arms will be aching, but I do not think this is anything alarming to worry about; hopefully not. Sometimes the pain will spread down to my stomach. But not often.   Stupid question, but during a race or workout where you're really pushing yourself, where do you feel discomfort? Legs? Lungs? Stomach? Both? What does it feel like?

running,"Tldr: Are my zero-drop shoes the problem or do I need to just strengthen and stretch my calves while I slow down my training program?   Hi all! I'm new to running (running for about  -  months). I started off using zero-drop shoes, mainly on accident, but I prefer them over shoes with drop and cushion. When I was in high-school I ran barefoot/with barefoot shoes, and I normal walk around barefoot or in flat shoes anyways, so the further I got into training and research of new shoes, the more I leaned towards sticking with zero drop shoes. Also, I have always ran striking with the pad/mid-foot, so I wasn't concerned about a lot of the common injuries that come with zero-drop because I do not heel strike.   I trained for a   and completed a race in November. All of my training went well and I was comfortable the whole time. I did the race on about an hour and   minutes (just for reference for later). After the race, I was ready to move on to a new goal: a half marathon. I increased my disrance way too fast and I ended up with gigantic blisters which caused me to take some time off. I biked and walked for a week, then started my training plan again, but slower.  Things were going well for about two weeks, but then my ankles started to hurt like crazy. I think it was because I started doing  -  runs on Saturdays with heavy elevation. It felt like I couldn't lower my foot all the way when I was running. I know that I pronate a little, so I thought maybe it was that, but it started getting so bad that my easy   runs hurt as well.  I went to physical therapist, but I'm in another country, so it was difficult trying to explain everything and understand everything. He told me that my calves were overcharged and we're ""blocking"" my ankles causing pain. He did electrotherapy and massaged them, then sent me home with calf stretches and exercises to strengthen them. He also told me that I needed to switch shoes to have more cushion.  I know I went to fast in my training program and I have slowed it down a lot. I'm only doing about   a week and at my slow pace (~ : - ). I do my exercises/stretches two times a day while putting heat on them every once in awhile. It helps, but they still hurt, and I'm assuming they are going to take awhile to heal.  My question is this: do I need to change my shoes to have some drop or just be slower in my training while I strengthen my calves and ankles? I really prefer zero-drop/shoes with less cushion because I feel that I have more control over myself and I would like to be able to keep them, but I do not want to do that at the expense of my health.","Pushed myself too hard while and now have pain in my inner ankles.

running,"Okay so a bit of background about the surgery first. I’m in my mid/late twenties, last year I had bunion surgery on my right foot which was a hereditary problem, my joint was always painful and my middle toe kept mysteriously bruising up (probably from taking on the majority of the motion). The first surgery failed and was over corrected (probably had something to do with my naturally flexible joints), so in February this year I had a soft tissue release and a bone graft put in place to stop the toe bone from slipping off the joint. The second surgery again wasn’t successful as my body had absorbed the donor bone and the bone slipped off the joint and my big toe was left pointing outwards at an extreme angle. Finally, in July I had a   MTP fusion (big toe joint fusion) and my surgeon was happy with the last set of X-rays.  While I’m much of an experienced runner, I ran as a hobby for some exercise in bouts before the surgeries wearing just a regular pairs of running trainers. My surgeon assured me that I’d be able to run with the fused toe but it will take a bit of time getting used to.  I’m looking for some tips/advices on how to get started with running again and finding it quite difficult to search online as most articles refer to arthritis related issues. Are there any known “methods” of running when there is little movement in the toe that does not cause further pain up towards the ankle or any recommended shoes to help supporting this?

My main goals with running are to cover medium to long distances (my current stamina allows for a   run on a really good day, but I'm out of shape and new to running, so I would be looking to get up to regular   runs multiple times a week)  My knees are not great, and do often hurt from day to day, although never really when I run. More when I have to apply a fair amount of weight to them.  The Cloudstratus drew my attention because of its focus on cushioning and stability, and I like the look of them. When I asked my friend, a distance runner who clears  + a week about them, he said they were relatively expensive for what they provided, and a pair of Clifton  's would do the same job for a little less money.  To me, it seems that the Clifton  's are cushioned well, but also designed to be light and speedy. I would like for the shoes I buy to keep me comfortable and healthy at long distance/moderate pace. I am not interested in speed work or racing, it's just not my thing.  Can anyone please give me some advice? I do not have the opportunity to try either pair really, so making my own mind up throught first hand experience would be difficult.

Super light, really helps with the turnover rate since it's not your standard trainer which can feel blocky at faster paces.   Upper: A coated mesh which really holds its shape well. I have used it for races too, but workouts where you're constantly changing pace really shows how it locks your foot in. Pebax heel counter really helps with it too.   Insole: Minimal, not much to say. Would not recommend replacing or adding to the insole in the shoe, it is firm for a reason: speed.   Midsole: The HyperBurst line from Skechers is really really responsive, and this line is working with something called M-Strike, which encourages a midfoot landing especially during workouts where speed and efficiency is key. There is also an exposed plate visible through the outsole made of nylon, and is what distinguishes this from a race day shoe (at least in my experience).

Now, after working out and doing intense biking for a year, I think it's something else entirely.  I still get an incredibly painful cramp on both sides of my torso extending from below my stomach to right under my ribs about two minutes into a run. It's not just about exercise either. I am an avid biker and often go for intense multiple hour rides with no problems at all. As soon as I get off and jog a bit, though, I will be doubled over in pain.  I have tried strictly managing hydration and nutrition for the day, not eating for three hours before a run, working out intercostal muscles, long stretching and warmup routines, different breathing patterns, and improving posture.  The only strategy I have found that works is doing wind sprints. The cramp has not set on by the time I am exhausted and the little seed of a cramp goes away over the rest period. I hate having to employ that strategy though.   I assume the problem lies with sensitivity to impacts, but I have not heard anybody with advice on how to mitigate this issue.

For reference, I'm a whopping   y/o F,  ' ""   lbs.  It happened mid October. This year I kicked my running frequency up to   days a week starting in March, because as a COVID nurse here in the US, there weren't/are not many activities I felt/feel comfortable doing.    - Mondays were distance days ( -  miles) - Tuesdays were recovery days ( -  miles) - Wednesday were speed training days (intervals for   miles or tempo for   miles) - Thursdays were also recovery days ( -  miles) - Fridays were intermittently recovery or short speed training (usually  -  miles)   I figured the injury would go away on it's own with rest from running, new OTC insoles, ibuprofen, and ice. However, when it came to early December with seemingly no change to the pain/severity, I went to see an orthopedic MD who confirmed my suspicion of my posterior tibialis tendonitis. They gave me an offloading boot to wear through the end of the year with my follow up on Dec  .

During winter, I wanted to continue with my running so I bought some new running shoes with spikes (IceBug), they were pretty pricey but considering we have heavy winters here I thought it was worth it.

The normal running shoes that I used in summer and autumn were advertised as waterproof, but they are clearly not fit for winter (not that I  didn't try), and WHY would running shoes with spikes not be waterproof? This made me think that maybe there are not any waterproof running shoes for some reason?  And second of all, in what do you all run in winter so you do not get wet?

But overall, my good habits with running were mostly ruined so I decided to give myself a new goal: complete a half marathon!    I got the half marathon plan from here and started following the beginner plan.     This got me back on track pretty well. The beginner plan has me running   days a week. I also became consistent in my weightlifting efforts.    Weightlifting was also   days a week following the philosophy from this [post](  My plan is [here](   I mostly just worried about T  and T  exercises.

I’m pretty happy with it but I’m doubting switching over to an Apple Watch SE cellular  . These are my pros and cons of either device:  Polar PRO:  - I like the polar flow sync and integration for setting goals, in the diary it gives you a full training program with running (based on hearth rate zones), mobility and stretching exercises for your goal - Lots of detailed data of my runs (cadence, heart rate zones, cardio load/ training impuls,...) and sleep (nightly recharge, autonomic nervous system charge, breathing rate, sleep charge/structure/solidity/regeneration/...) - Polar app on iPhone, I find it relatively easy to see and interpret my data - Battery life  POLAR CONS:  - does not have cellular, so I need to take my iPhone with me for Spotify etc (big one for me) - Pretty heavy, I do not mind it during the day or during my activities but it’s not pleasant at night.   out of   days I wake up without my watch on my wrist. I think I take it, not knowingly, off during my sleep.  APPLE WATCH PRO:  - I like the square design more - Apples ecosystem - Cellular, so from streaming Spotify to taking calls and answering texts. Which means that I can leave my iPhone at home or in my car more often. (Big pro for me) - Weighs less and smaller = more comfortable  APPLE WATCH CONS:  - Far less detailed running data and sleep analyzing - Battery life   What’s holding me against getting the Apple Watch is that the running data, as far as I know, isn’t as detailed as on the Polar and not having something like the full training program from Polar Flow which you can then link with your watch. I’m training for a marathon so the detailed data on my running/sleeping is pretty handy. I know Nike run club has something similar, but I do not know if it’s any good... But on the other hand I hate taking my phone with me during runs for music or to make a quick call or something.

Anyway, after the advice, I decided to pretty much increase me walking and add in running. I ran until it stopped feeling good and took rest days when I was sore. This has now meant that I can run   in one go. I have a very loose goal of being able  to run  -  by the last week of January.  I’m pretty proud of my progress. I know it’s not the traditional way, but I am also working on becoming more in tune with my body on a whole and have started meditation.  The only issue I’m having is managing my calories in. I wouldn’t have thought the slight increase in activity would have that much of an impact on my calorie requirements but I have already lost  . I do not count calories, but I do not eat fast food or high fat/sugar food as I can’t tolerate it. My stomach is smaller than other people my ages and isn’t able to accommodate what most people would class as a normal sized meal (it won’t stretch or get any bigger either) so I have to have multiple smaller meals through the day. Fortunately I have secured a job that allows multiple breaks during the day but that does not start until end of January.  I run first thing in the morning as it wakes me up for the day. I can’t eat beforehand as it makes me nauseous and then the running itself tends to stop me being hungry. I’m thinking of adding some sort of drink about an hour after my ‘run’ just to keep my intake up.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for being so supportive.

running,"I started running   months ago and i took a punt on the Nike Pegasus   as my first shoe and i really like them, Before i started running i had a pair of air max   which i used to wear casually, i ran in them a few times at the start and the first thing that struck me when i switched to the Pegasus was how much cushioning and absorption i could feel over the air max   it was amazing.   The only thing i dislike about the Pegasus is i do not feel there is much support at the rear, i wish the heel/ankle area came up higher if that makes sense, i do not know if this is just the way running shoes are or not because i also used to pay basket ball so i am used to high tops with lots of ankle support.  I would like to try out another shoe but not sure which to go for, obviously due to covid and new restrictions where i live i can't just go to a shop and try things on.

Climbing - grab your climbing shoes, your running backpack and a nice green apple. You know what to do.

I didn't want to exercise at that point since I already had to deal mentally with not breaking my caloric deficit. I gave myself a weight goal before I was going to start doing any physical activity. When I hit that goal, which was exactly   months ago, I went for a run.         I knew it was going to be hard after years of being fat, but it was downright embarassing. Ran   and had to sit down for a solid   minutes and fight for breath. But I didn't quit. I went back the next day... and the next... and the next...         I had to face multiple problems. I got weirdly injured twice (both times had to take a   day break). First injury was the worst - a strained muscle in my pelvic area. Couldn't visit a doctor due to COVID. I do not know how I did it, but I just woke up with a very painful spot. The worst part was everytime I sneezed the pain would come back worse than before. It seemed like this muscle's only use is to contract while sneezing. Through trial and error I figured out how to twist my body when I felt like sneezing and managed to stop it from contracting. I went back to running when I fully healed and ran my first   shortly after.         I kept pushing,  , then   and so I decided that it was time to run a half marathon.

I found this quite funny since the last time I saw the doctor was two years prior when I came in due to high BP with   . I asked him why my heart rate spiked to  % when I tried to run anywhere near   min/km ( :  min/mile). His answer was ""Yea, years of being obese and inactive tend to do that.

I have noticed I have been inconsistent w my running routine and practice over the years and do not really feel like I have made the progress I feel I should have made by now.

running,"I’m new to running in general. I started in late May/early June and have been consistent with it. But obviously I started outside when it was warmer. However since last month, with a few exceptions, I have been going to the local Rec center and using their treadmills because of weather/cold (yes I know you can run in the cold, but I’m a freeze baby and even with layers I just do not have a good time).  There were some things I noticed within the first week of using treadmills (also my first time with running equipment): a). It was so much less stressful than running outside! Sounds pretty self explanatory but I hadn’t given thought to just how much mental energy I was using watching out for potholes, upward tilting sidewalks, poor drivers, bicyclists, etc. B). Probably r/t point a)., but I found it so much easier to get “in the zone” on a tread. I mean, within minutes of focusing on my breath and staring straight ahead, it’s as though I’m transfixed and in a state of unawareness, bit conscious enough to know of my surroundings. C). Obviously, won’t have to deal with snow/high winds if you are like me and get pummeled by winter weather. D). You can control the speed and see how fast you’re running in real time.  Some of the cons: a). lack of change of scenery, can get dull if not in a good headspace. B). Dirty gym equipment, c). To me, the act of running on a treadmill feels almost unnatural and it definitely feels different (to me) than running. D). The urge to keep looking at your pace/mileage/time is too real and can keep you out of the moment (I have started to just cover those metrics up). E). I miss hearing nature when running.  One other possible pro: I have gone outside to run one time in December since using the treadmill, and I swore I was running so slow and it felt much different than the tread. However when I had finished running   miles, I ran in just under an hour and at a significantly faster pace than the month prior when my pace was stagnant.

running,"Ok I’m embarrassed to say that as a physical therapist and someone with a background in exercise science, I cannot effectively argue with my wife about how her theoretical training plan won’t work.  My wife is asking why you can’t train (or why people do not train) to run long distances by purely sprint training.    Example: pick what pace you want to run a   at (example   minute pace).  Day   of training you try to run at the   min pace as far as you can.  Day   you try to run a little farther at the   min pace.  Each day you would do that until you are able to do it for an entire  .  Obviously this is a bad way of training, but why?  I understand that if   minute pace is all out for you, then you are working your anaerobic energy system and never working the aerobic system.  I’m guessing her method would work if it was put into intervals and you did it repeatedly during a session and turned into HIIT training.

running,"Hi all, first-time runner here. I have been an avid walker for years, and would typically challenge myself with hills/hiking and speedwalking, but have always been afraid of running. After doing more research I recently decided to try transitioning to running, and I have been loving it. The key has been to run reaaaaally slowly. Since late November, I have gone from celebrating running my first mile without stopping (and feeling really sore the next day) to running a couple of miles and feeling like I could go on for more but stopping because I do not want to do too much too soon.   I'm undecided what my next goal should be. The options I'm considering are  ) run a couple of miles every day/every other day, combined with walking/hiking,  ) try HIIT and run  -  times a week,  ) try increasing my speed overall  -  times a week, and  ) try increasing my distance overall  -  times a week. I do feel like I'm still trying to figure out what a comfortable gait and form are for me.   One of the things I love about running is that you can get into the same meditative zone as you can while walking. Today I felt like I had just entered that meditative zone when I realized that I had only half a mile to go before hitting my two-mile goal. I felt so disappointed.  Anyway. This is sort of an invitation for folks to weigh in on how I can/should push myself and mostly a celebration of running being awesome.

Because of the latter, I lean a bit toward running shorter and more manageable distances more frequently (thus option number   above).

running,"Hi, my name is flamingcrepes and my last run was October   I thought I was handling the pandemic well, and it turns out it was mostly (probably only) because of running. Here comes my pity party...  Backstory: I have had knee issues for almost   years. I finally decided to go to an orthopedist this year (before pandemic times, therefore I ended up dealing with drs offices during, yay). Pain would show up the day after exercise, and be pretty awful, stairs were a nightmare. MRI in February.   Cartilage was gone. In both knees. Cortisone didn’t touch the pain. Nothing. I was told it was a miracle cure, but whatever. Orthovisc was administered in mid/late June. By the first week of September, the pain was back, worse and starting during runs. Doc sent me to a different doc because he can’t do a MACI procedure (cloning some of my cartilage, growing it and cookie cuttering it into place). Wait a month for new doc, and he says, “I only do replacements, you do not need that.” Awesome, I waited a month for that?!??   Miraculously, new new doc had an appointment on Friday (this was Monday) and I got some more PT prescribed. Month later, surgery is planned. On the  , I go under. It might be an arthroscopy to gather a shred of cartilage to clone, it might be a realignment of the patella. All depends on the cartilage situation or lack thereof.   I’m a mess.

Just throbbing waves of pain and fatigue, accompanied by what felt like leg tremors. I had to walk the rest of the way.

running,"I started running two-ish months ago. I was a complete couch potato, haven't even been walking much this year due to covid. Depression was sneaking in because of everything that has happened this year, it has been so much more than just covid for me. Figured I should start exercising because it is a known fact that it helps with your mood. Running felt like the obvious option because it's easy to start and cheap. I had done exercise in my life, but always absolutely hated running. So I made sure to start slow. At my first jog I told myself it is ok to mostly walk as long as I run a little bit. Still felt like death. I was horrified at my terrible condition. At first the runs were more walking than running.  Last night I ran   kilometres (a little less than   miles for all my Americans in here). It was my longest run so far. I know it is not much compared to actual runners, but I myself can't believe it! I am immensely proud of myself. Me, who always hated running and getting out of breath in general. I can do that?! I used to get out of breath when walking! Now no amount of walking will make me even break a sweat. My body can suddenly do so much. I feel so strong and so healthy! In all my   years on this earth I have never been in such good condition. I have less aches and pains in general, am less bloated, do not get cold as easy, my heart rate has lowered (I have been monitoring it due to medication) and I am even stretchier although I haven't been stretching much at all. I have never before been able to reach my toes while legs straight! Even my self esteem is better, I feel more capable and love what I see in the mirror although I couldn't have visually changed much at all. And what's more, I am one of the lucky few who get intense runner's highs quite easily! No wonder I am HOOKED.  I feel very accomplished to have stuck to running this long. Even though it's factually not that long, it's long for me. I tend to start hobbies with great enthusiasm and stop pretty darn fast. I can't stop talking about running. I am boring everyone around me, but I'm just so happy and excited. This hobby has helped me immensely with very tough times I have been having. My only regret is I didn't start sooner. Who would've though I'd fall in love with running of all things.   Thank you if you read this unnecessarily long ramble!

I started running last year in October, with the hope to run a half marathon this year. My training went pretty good but I got some injury that kept me from running for some months. Basically I didnt run from May until November.  I started building it up again,very slowly. Running   times a week. Starting with   and now doing around   per run. Usual pace is around  : . Ive been running together with my fiancée. She usually plays volleyball but with the pandemic that is cancelled, so she joins me to keep her fitness up. And its fun to run together.  ### Pre-race I was pretty nervous. My previous run I was way too hot (was about   and I was wearing leggings, long sleeve shirt and another shirt on top), so decided to just wear shirts and a long sleeve shirt. Rather be cold than hot.   The race is a pretty big thing locally, but because of Corona they made virtual races with Strava segments (more on that later).   We arrived and parked near the start finishline. We had seen on facebook that they had put a big banner on the road as official start/finish point, but we couldnt find it. Called someone and walked around a bit, but no luck. Meanwhile I started getting cold, of course.   ### Race We decided to just go for it, and went off. A lot of runners had started in front of us, which was nice. I had planned on putting some guide paces on my Garmin, but forgot. So we just decided to run at easy pace for a bit.  Being nervous, my fiancée told me to slow down (good call). Settled in at  :  pace for the first km.  Feeling good (change of scenery is great) we naturally started going a bit faster ( : ). The weather was great, cold and hardly any wind. I still felt fine with the pace even if I was worried about not finishing.  At   k the   loop and our   loop merged and if luck would have it, we came accross my fiancée's brother. He was doing all the loops ( + + ) and is a great runner. We yelled some encouraging words, he returned them and after a few seconds he recognized us. We ran together, but told him to go ahead (because his pace usually is  : :  or something like that) but he said he was happy to run together.  He did go a bit faster that I wanted but it resulted in a pretty fast (for me)  :  third k.  Between   and   I started to feel more tired and felt the pace was a bit too fast for me.

At around   she asked if she could catch up to him and race him.  Didnt want to pull her back and feeling that I couldn't go much faster, I told her to go for it.   She caught up and they sped off. This was pretty hard mentally but did try not to let my pace fall too much and finish.   At the finish I stopped my garmin and it only said  .

I’m going to stay away from other forms of plyometrics as it seems too risky for a   year old and I have read a study or   stating that short sprints with plenty of rest are more effective than plyometrics for running speed, and even jumping.,   The problem is I am not sure what type of bounding I should be doing i.e. running bounding, bounding up hills, straight leg bounding , bounding for distance or height , etc .. ?  Also, if I assume ‘ running bounding’ or alternate leg bounding  is the best for middle distance runners, what are common mistakes that people make or what key points should they focus on ? I haven’t found much on internet, besides videos of people bounding.

Years ago, my doctor diagnosed me with “crunchy knees.” His treatment was simple, “If you can run   miles a day, you won’t have crunchy knees.” The problem was just as simple, I can’t run due to my crunchy knees. “Oh well,” I thought. “I’ll just be one of those ‘peaked in high school’ guys.”  I let myself go.  Until this year.    months ago I thought, “Y’know... I have got   young boys who need their dad to *not* be a  . couch potato.

My stats are   years old, male,  '  "",   if that helps.

Even at   I can chat and just about feel like I'm exerting myself.  The problem is, because my max should be  , I feel like anything higher might be dangerous to sustain (and I do start to fatigue between  - , which I can hit if I'm running faster than  /h, which I know is not very fast!)

I'd have to run at  /h in order to keep my heart rate low enough and wasn't even breaking a sweat.  So my question is: should I try to get comfortable sustaining high heart rates when running in order to get faster, or should I try to keep it within the recommended ranges and just aim for longer distances instead to build up my base at a lower heart rate?

running,"Seeking some advice: I started running a few months ago and I have been very cautious when it comes to injuries. I followed this full body stretching routine video on YouTube, after a little light stretching on my own, which is almost   long and then I went out for running (  currently). I came back and for cool down I did some recovery yoga (about  ) and then some body weight exercises. The problem with the pre run stretching video though, is that it mainly consists of static movements, not many dynamic ones.  But this was working fine for me (although I did feel a little sore sometimes) but now my schedule has changed a little and that's why I am not getting enough time to do all this. All of this sums up to about a couple of hours in the morning and I can't really afford that rn but I also do not want to quit running.   So I came across this one video which was about warming up for a run in   and then cool down in   (both by the Run Experience channel on YouTube). I watched the entire video and I thought it was actually sufficient to get me going. That and also the fact that most of these running channels advise you to warm up properly, not necessarily stretch before the run.   Long story short, I followed both of those videos today and found the result to be okay-ish. I feel no soreness and the starting of my jog was quite pleasant today. So I just wanted to know about:   The long term effects, if any, of this routine that I followed today.   What routine do you guys follow.   Is it healthy to just stretch while warming up and then going out for a run?   Is this routine sufficient to keep me healthy in the long run?  The video I followed today for warmup includes knee hugs, jumping jacks, leg swings, high knees, calf pedals, inchworms and butt kicks. The cooldown video includes  squat hold, downward dog, upward dog, pigeon stretch, child's pose. Is this enough?  I am relatively new to running and I have no one to discuss all of this with, so that's why the long post.

First some details about me:  Started running to lose weight, without any real knowledge so I just did that for a year   days a week between  -  km a day and did a few half marathons. Then reduced that to   a week as I started doing more weight training for another year.   So... About half a year ago, I started having pain at my left outer knee. First couple of weeks it would feel like it would pop in and out of socket along with pain while walking, bending the knee, going up and down the stairs, squatting etc.  Naturally I went to my doctor, he did all his tests and said there was no damage to my bands and whatnot. Next stop physical therapist, he concluded it had to with the way I walk, supposedly I land on the side of my feed rather than on my heel and then using my big toe, and this is something that could build up for years and suddenly you'd just feel the pain? So he recommended podiatric orthotics. I have been using them for   weeks now, very slowly feeling less pain. But whenever I engage in any activity, irritating my knee like a couple of air squats, it just feels like I lost weeks in progress the next day in terms of pain. And so as a result I just haven't trained my legs or went for a jog in half a year. I went to a different physical therapist last week and she felt like it had to do with an immobility of my hip, so my knee is compensating.   Now by no means am I qualified to make this call and Googling your own symptoms is usually a bad idea, but I came across ITBS yesterday and I was just so surprised that neither one of my PTs mentioned this to me.

running,"As the year winds down and a new one is coming around, lots of people are going to put running on their resolution list, which is always a good thing. With the year we've had though, many who want to really get into running were sedentary most of the year and just getting out and running seems like a really good idea...until we get out and realise we can't just *do it* yet.   I know there are a lot of posts and guides here about ""how do I start running/I have never run before/ What program should I use"". In my experience most of the programs and advice, while they are very good programs and advice for beginner runners, can be a bit far-fetched for someone who truly and genuinely never ran a day in their life. Personally, as wonderful as the C  program is, it felt waaaay too hard in the beginning and I dreaded every day I had to train. I didn't understand why I was having trouble running when I have danced and ""gym""ed my whole life. I was physically strong and considerably fit, but the problem was, as I learned after quitting the program twice, my muscles were not used to be being used like that and hurt because I was pushing them too fast. That, plus my asthma really kept calling me out   seconds into every jog for doing the utmost. I wasn't ready to just start jogging and running from week one.   So this is what I did instead. I hope that this can help someone who is in the same place I was: mentally you want to run, but physically you just can't get it done yet. Consider this the bridge between truly couch potato-ing and starting a run program. I also appreciate any discussion or critique of the methods I used as I am still in the phase of trying to get my muscles used to being used without pushing my lungs too hard.   *^(NB: I am a cis-female in my early  , with a BMI of about   and a BF% of   I have a history of sports and active lifestyle, which led to me injuring every joint of my body (except my toes and left hip) at least once.

Cheers!)*  # Build an achievable and enjoyable habit  There are   parts of a habit: cue, craving, response, reward. This is for both good and bad habits. If you want details of these you can read [about habit building and see some real-life examples of these parts in play](  Instead of forcing myself to make a new habit, I picked a habit that already existed for me: I usually walk in a circle around the outside of my house (it's one of my autistic compulsions)   times every day. Now, I put on my shoes each time I do that, which triggers a new cue to prepare to run, and the response became that on at least one of those trips I follow my ""Bridge Plan"" instead. I am able to satisfy the craving and reward myself without disrupting my routine too much. The craving is to move around (which is easier outside than inside) and the reward I guess is some kind of happy hormone I do not naturally have enough of. As I said, I'm not a doctor LOL.   # Listen to your body  Now about the actual routine. All of my ""workouts"" have been done to a mixture of time and distance. It takes me about   minutes, or     songs, to briskly walk one kilometre ( ). There's also a sort of park-like area   from my house. Using this I devised time and physical markers for the journey, eg, a  -minute walk is to a particular house that is just over halfway, and back home;   minutes is to the park and back home;   minutes is to the park, one lap around the   football fields, and back home, etc. The workout looks something like this:      |Week|Sunday|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| | | | | |rest| | | | | | | |rest| | | | | | | |rest| | | | | | | |rest| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  My hope is that after week   I can substitute the  + walks for walk/jogs until I am able to walk/jog every scheduled day. It may not happen that quickly and I may still come back to this walking after a week on C  if my body says to. By this time next year though, I hope I can have a habit of easily running these times without stopping!   Some other links that helped me in planning were choosing playlists that fit the [BPM](  of my walking cadence and a [pedometer map](  to help me see the distances of landmarks in my area.

running,"I have had to postpone training for at least two weeks or so now due to excruciating knee pain and shin splints that came on at work a few days after my last session - perhaps I over-exerted myself. I also believe that my shoes might not have been suitable for my arches (or lack of, rather).   I hobbled through a week and a half of work in agony hoping that it was something that would fix itself but coming up two weeks now of that not happening, I have had to give in and phone a doctor and take sick leave from work to have consistent rest days. I managed to get a phone consultation to speak to a physio before Christmas and, for the time being, I have been icing my knees and shins, taking painkillers and attempting to do stretches in hope of relieving the pain.  The pain in my knees has subsided from how bad it was prior to taking sick leave; however, it’s travelled round to the inner area of both knees and it does not seem to want to budge (the best way I can describe the exact location is the area that touches when you stand with your legs together). Combined with those damn shin splints, it’s uncomfortable to say the least - especially at night.   As I mentioned, I have been icing it and then switching between heat with hot baths and heat packs and it’s helping to relieve the pain, though not for long. I also attempt to do two or three stretching sessions during the day. On top of that, I have been using creams (deep heat, deep freeze, etc.) but I do not feel as if it touches the pain whatsoever.   Until I’m able to speak to the physio, I was wondering if someone could recommend a particular stretch for this area or anything else that might help to ease the pain. The reason I ask is because I feel that stretches helped to subside the original all-over pain; however, I can’t quite seem to find one that gets to where I need it to.   Any help would be appreciated, thank you!",Can anyone recommend stretches for inner knee pain (if such a thing exists)?,whatdreamitis,1608472763,2020-12-20 13:59:23,0

running,"For all my childhood, I really hated running and dreaded the P.E. tests.  Usually, I was the slower fatter kid that got   minute miles.   Cut to college, I decided to take up running, since I read that sedentary lifestyles such as sitting in an office would increase risk of early heart disease.  Knowing that I hated running, I still tried.      After a few months, I fell into a nice routine of a good   miles per run, and   runs per week.  Maybe it was the route I took that had minimal street intersections, but that was the max distance I usually took.  And right now, I regret not going farther and farther, like when I see people here run   miles in one go.  Zoning out in my runs and just letting my legs do the work was the best part, with the music too.  On the off-chance I developed symptoms of a cold, i.e. sore throat, runny nose, etc, I would look forward to a run to speed up the recovery and feel great after, rejuvinated.  Now, it seems a possibly permanent injury prevents me from running more than a mile at best.      For context, the job I took involved some heavy lifting, and the rate they had us work at was demoralizing.  Over   hours of lifting crates of water bottles, reams of paper, and rolls of toilet paper wasn't what did it.  Reality was, it was a singular accident on the knee.      Moreover, it seemed to heal alright for a while after.  You couldn't believe I actually fell and smashed my inner knee into what was essentially a block of metal.      Pretty much though, I vowed to never shop with this company again.  Especially when I found out the same happened to others, told to work through an injury.  Read the same articles so many times with different names in different locations.  My knee would have been fine for life, but now I'll never know.  As someone desperate for a job during pandemic, I decided to take on a similar job in the same company.  Now due to the even heavier nature of the items, I realized my movements aggravated my injury I thought had totally healed.  Eventually, moving a   pound cart placed probably some lateral stress on my knee, and now, it hurts.  Now, when I run, I find that I can't run the full three miles.  Two and a half miles in the knee hurts like shockwaves.      Knowing I wanted to run, I try again.  Now, it hurts after two miles.  Ensue my third try, it hurt after a mile and a half.  Ensue my fourth try, it hurts after a mile, but I still finish another mile on it.      Imbecilic mistake.  Now, I'm thinking of seeing an appointment with a doctor/kinesiologist and hoping that this issue isn't forever.  Just a dumb fall, and my plans to maintain mobility from college years to way past retirement are now ruined.  Understand one reason I ran was to defy the future aging process that confines my grandmother to a wheelchair as you are reading this now.  Really sucks for me right now, and it's a sad thing when I can't really run, not for fun, or even to avoid a criminal/robber, or even run to help someone.

I started with some standard Nikes and they were alright, but Im a pretty big person (started at  , now about  ), and they just didnt quite work out for me.

running,"Looking for some thoughts/feedback/tips from anyone who has had a metatarsal stress fracture or a medical professional or trainer who's familiar with this injury.   I was diagnosed with a stress fracture at the base of the right second metatarsal and a stress reaction to the first metatarsal base and distal cuneiform about a week and a half ago. The pain started suddenly during a run in mid October (the last time i ran)-I stopped running but continued to take long walks and exercise using an aerobic step. Initially my foot felt better but over time the pain worsened prompting me to see a podiatrist-nothing was noted on an X-ray so an MRI was ordered which picked up the injury.   I'm on crutches with no weight bearing for a minimum of  -  weeks (it's about a week and a half in at this point). I'm not even allowed to use a stationary bike right now. This is driving me crazy as I'm used to being an active person.   I am   and have been running since I was   and aside from having plantar fasciitis in my right foot in the late Spring and early Summer I have never been injured. Prior to the injury, I was actually running less than I used to-about   or   fairly slow paced miles typically   or   days a week. The days I didn't run I exercised with an aerobic step for about   minutes to an hour per day. In addition to running and doing the aerobic step in the morning, I walked about   minutes in the evening most days per week. On the weekends instead of running or using the aerobic step I'd hike anywhere from   to   hours. I also lift light weights (  lbs to   lbs) about   days per week and stand intermittently throughout the day at work (I have a desk that I can adjust from sitting to standing).   I'm trying to figure out what caused the injury and how to prevent it in the future. I would love to rehab faster but everything I have read states that it takes time and you have to rest. When I had plantar fasciitis in May/June, I switched to the very heavily padded Hoka One One Bondi shoes (I was wearing Asics). By September when it was time for me to replace my shoes, I thought it would be better for me to switch back to a less heavily padded shoe. I went to a running shop and they recommended Saucony Guide  's which I was wearing when I first noticed the pain in October.   Could it be a gait change due to Plantar's that trigged the fracture? The change in shoes? My age catching up with me? I didn't have a sudden increase in activity-I have been exercising like this for years. My diet is good but as a result of the injury I have increased my calcium and Vitamin D.   Sorry this is so long-if you've made it this far I appreciate your patience!
