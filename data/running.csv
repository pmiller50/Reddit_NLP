### Training
 I used the Nike Run Club app for all of my training, opting for the 26 week plan to give myself plenty of time to train and account for injuries that could occur. I learned early on that I hate speed work, but love the feeling after hard speed runs so that kept me motivated to keep hitting those hard runs as best I could. In week 12 of my training, I was near the end of my 8 mile long run when I tripped and scraped my hands and knees pretty badly. I jogged it out and vowed to be more careful on my runs to avoid tripping again. 2 weeks later, my knees were all healed up and I was doing a speed run in the dark and I tripped while on an especially dark part of the sidewalk, reopening my freshly healed knees. Luckily that was my last fall of training.

 I had run a half-marathon prior to this with little training so I was unsure of what I was getting myself into with this, but I came out of training with a new love for running and new PRs for my 5k, 10k, and half-marathons!

### Pre-race
 The days leading up to the race were busy but restful with it being Christmastime which was also favorable in terms of nutrition. I was able to get a good portion of carbs in throughout the days leading up to the race and took a short jog the day before to make sure my body was loosened up. The night before, I made sure my playlist was solid and I had my route memorized and went to bed fairly early feeling a bit anxious but ready for the race.

### Race
 I was hoping the forecast was wrong, but this ended up being my coldest run yet. Living in Florida, we don't get much cold weather, so a 30F start at 6:30AM was definitely a shock to the system. I felt strong starting off from my house and a friend surprised me and showed up to run the first half with me. Going through downtown I was right on pace and crossing the first bridge, I had another friend surprise me to run with for the next 7 miles too. 

Going through a neighborhood during mile 9, I misstepped coming off the sidewalk and tweaked my knee which came back to hurt a lot later in the run. 

I came back across the river and was surprised by a crowd of family and friends that my wife had organized to cheer me on throughout the second half of the marathon. As I passed the 13 mile point, my wife hopped on her bike to follow me and cheer me on as I went through the remainder of the race.

Around mile 14, my knee started to hurt more from the tweak and so I had to slow down and walk for portions to give my knee a rest and stretch it as much as I could. 

I felt great, albeit a little sore, moving past mile 20 and was ready to finish it. Around mile 21 my knee locked up for a second and I almost tripped and seriously thought about giving up for a minute, but as I walked through a corner I was greeted by cheering and my friend who had run a short part earlier came back to help me finish it off. 

I felt strong crossing the last bridge and with a 60/40 mix of walking/running I was able to power through the finish line and complete my first marathon!

### Post-race
 I walked around and talked with everyone who had come to cheer me on (socially distanced of course) and drank a gatorade and water and ate a banana and muffin. The soreness in my knee didn't set it until that night, but icing it and moving on it has made the pain almost completely disappear! Overall, I'm much less sore than I expected to be, yet sore in places I didn't expect to be. I'm taking 2-3 weeks off for recovery, but I plan to train some more and focus on speed and get back out there to PR my marathon time sometime next year!

running,"Back in in the beginning of the year... I was struggling. I was 345 lbs, dealing with addiction to alcohol and binge eating, a terribly combative divorce proceeding, and unpacking all of my childhood, marital and my own problems among other things. 

Looking through my post/comment history will illuminate some of this but the short of it is I was in a bad way...

However, a colleague and dear friend who was helping me saw how much I was struggling and challenged me to a run. 10 miles... By mile 8 of goose stepping through it... I was done. I found a park bench and conversed with the universe and myself questioning why in the ever living fuck did I do this?!

After that, a few weeks of recovery passed and more self loathing ensued... However, one fateful random thought managed to lift myself out of a youtube binging haze and I found myself in front of a mirror... All of the therapy for  the past two years had tried to teach me to love myself but nothing stuck. However, this time...Really looking at who I was and how miserable I was but still being able to smile and laugh changed something. It broke the depression kitty and anxiety mosquitos grasp and I finally learned what it meant to love myself. 

After that, I found this subreddit and higdons novice 1 half marathon and set out...The rest is written down in other subs and posts but suffice to say, in tallying up my miles in my little black run/exercise book I just crossed the 1,000 mile threshold! In that distance, I've run 1 marathon, 10+ half marathons or greater distance this year and consistent mileage almost every day. Also with all the running has come better diet management and eating habits and I've hit my goal weight of 210 and lost 135 pounds. Many other positives have also come to fruition such as the finalization of the divorce and work happenings but as I sit here quietly after a tough day... I think this pandemic and that run have been the absolute best thing that could have happened for me at that moment. All of that extra commute time and later in the day showering capability opened up my mornings to the sun rise runs. Being able to cook all of my meals on the spot brought back my cooking skills and creativity to manage my diet in better ways. And all of the quiet evening time gave me an ability to focus on the positives and rest to be ready for my next run...

Now, I have several ideas of what my goals for next year will be but the one thing I know I will be looking forward to is my runs... 

Thanks for all of your support and reading and I hope you have found a small piece of happiness even in this gloomy year.","1,000 Miles, 135 lbs, 1 marathon, 10 half's +, a divorce, and a pandemic...",jeffrrw,1609269404,2020-12-29 19:16:44

running,"I'm planning on running a half marathon in May (it may just be me running it, not at an actual race because it has to be in May and a lot of races are cancelled) and I'm creating a half-marathon schedule now.

I've always been super athletic and played 4 sports throughout high school but I got a bad head injury and stopped all of it for a long time as I was recovering so I know a lot about being an athlete, but I've never done this kind of distance running training before. I was just kind of always in shape, so I don't know how to build up from my concussion. More background, I'm a full time online college student and I'll be in Phoenix, Arizona, I'm 18F.

I guess I have a few questions, but any additional input would be awesome.

1. How often do you guys strength train/cross train? I was thinking about 2x a week running, 2x a week strength, and 2x a week cross training (mostly consisting of hiking mountains/biking).
2. Is doing weeks where you decrease mileage important? Like how one week you run 10mi on a day and then the next week you go down to 5mi for a day?
3. What do you do to keep yourself entertained while running? I like how music keeps me hype, but there's not a lot of stimulation in it. If I listen to podcasts, it's interesting but I don't feel hype. I wish you could do both at once.

Any other tips you have for a first time half-marathon runner would be greatly appreciated :) I already ordered a lot of books from the library too for research.

running,"Been running consistently for the past 4 years or so, and this last year I upped my active days from 2 to 3. This consists of 2x 5-6 mile runs during the week and usually one 8-13 mile run at the weekend. Because I was running more I decided to buy 2 pairs of shoes and rotate them - one cheaper pair for my shorter weekday runs and one more expensive pair just for the long weekend runs.

I'm not talking big money (in fact my expensive pair are probably others' budget pair). My 'expensive' pair, Asics Gel Excite, were around 40GBP. Now I've had both for about a year, so each have done 500-600 miles each. The cheap ones (15GBP Kalenji from the Decathlon website) definitely need replacing, for one thing the grips have worn significantly and they have lost the little bounce they had. But the Asics are still pretty decent - not as bouncy as when they were new of course, but still have some softness, grips are pretty good and no holes anywhere.

So rather than replace both I'm considering just getting a new pair for longer runs, again spending 40-50GBP and using the Asics for my midweek runs until they are either worn out or feel uncomfortable, at which point I'll buy another cheap pair.

Has anyone else done similar? I searched the sub and found other saying they use their old running shoes for walking, gardening, every day use etc, but not for shorter runs.

running,"This isn't a real race (hopefully I can race a half soon!), but just a report on how my morning half marathon went. 

(feel free to skip these next 2 paragraphs): 

In March of this year, I ran a 10k PR of 46:34, and a couple weeks later, I decided to run a half for the first time on my own. I started out pretty conservatively, and sped up throughout. I finished in 1:52 and was satisfied with how it went. I didn't really have any time goals, and was excited that I ran at an 8:36 pace per mile. In August, I wanted to get under 1:50, but I ran a 1:59. It was hot and even started thundering, and I drastically slowed down (almost walking) at mile 12. I knew the heat played a big role, and it was still a good time, but I was discouraged not to PR.

This fall, I had a good cross country season, even with the fewer meets due to COVID. I kept up my training during November/December, and felt motivated to run more. Recently, I started thinking about trying to time trial a half marathon again. In November, I ran a 10k time trial and got literally the same exact time (46:34), but I still was hopeful I could PR in the half. I set an ambitious goal of subbing 1:45 because then I would be averaging under 8 min/mile!

RACE REPORT: I worked out a race plan after googling and posting here on this sub reddit. Today, I pretty much followed the plan, and it actually went better than I thought. Mile 1 I ran in 8:28, and I took the next 4 or so miles pretty easy (miles 2 &amp; 3 were had long gradual uphills). I felt good coming through the 10k in just under 51 minutes. (Original plan was to do roughly a  51 min 1st 10k, 49 min 2nd 10k, last 0.7 sprint). Mile 7 I felt really good! I had picked it up a bit, found a rhythm, and felt like picking it up more. Miles 7-9 were just under 8 minutes, and had some hills. Mile 9.5 was where I really felt the fatigue. I was panicking a bit because it didn't look like I would achieve my goal unless I picked it up. I got to mile 10 and continued to push. Once I hit mile 12, I was in a lot of discomfort, desperately wanted to stop and just call it a tempo long run, but I tried to make it to 12.6, then 12.8, then the final sprint. The last couple of miles finally had some nice downhills, which I took advantage of. Then, it was done and the best feeling ever! 

Was excited to share this! Will take any advice for how to improve (maybe sub 1:42 half, sub 46 10k) and questions. I know people suggested running more even splits, which I will definitely keep in mind for next time after I've been really training for this. Just wanted to start slower in case I couldn't hold it.

running,"Hii to all runners !! 

I am indebted to this sub for helpful suggestions corresponding to running. I would like to share some lessons/experiences and hope they will prove helpful for  runners on this sub.
1) If you are beginner, donot be in hurry to speed up. Condition your body by doing slow continuous running for 2-3 months on soft surface. Once your body gets conditioned then sky is the limit.
2) During morning it is always advisable to work on stamina rather  than speed. Speed works require warm conditions. Try to schedule your speed works during day time or evening.
3) It is always advisable to break your practice/running sessions in two portions. Practicing/running twice a day always bring better results as compared to one hard session.
4) After hard training/running in morning, cat naps are powerful tool to rejuvinate your body and can prepare your body for evening sessions.
5) If you are doing road running then use spongy shoes with flexible soles to avoid injury.
6) If you want to run fast, then strength of legs has to be improved. The best way to improve leg strenth is  hill running. Runners living in planes can improve leg strength by running in sand strips(if any).
7) For long runs, road is always preferable to 400 metres track. Long runs on 400m track are very boring and  mentally tiring.
8) For long runs always try to make groups of enthusiastic runners. Long runs are more about mental strength than physical strength. It feels easy while running in groups.
9) As far as running posture is concerned you can bend your arms at 90 degree from elbows and keep your shoulders loose. 
10 ) For fast recovery after runs, hydrate yourself and take proteins(from shakes or sprouted grains) within half an hour of completion of training session.
11)  Avoid over loading your body. Its always ok to slow down or miss some training/sessions if you feel so. Some symptoms of overloading are reduced hunger, irritability, sleeplessness etc. Donot be too hard on yourself, always remind yourself that you have to turn up tommorrow as well.
12) Variation is the key to develope harmonious relationship with running. Try to spice up your running sessions with stamina sessions, speed sessions, ABC exercises, tempo runs, slow-fast sessions, hill running, sand running, power running etc.
13) Sleep is the best friend of the runners. Sound sleep in the night,catnaps,power naps etc. has potential to rejuvinate runners and can amplify their performance in the track.
14) Donot forget to stretch after running. Stretching and running are inseparable. 
15) Hot water baths and diaphragmatic breathing( sudarshan kriya) go a long way in recovery after hard sessions.

running,"Hello all

I'm trying to get a jumpstart on my 2021 resolution of finally getting ""good"" at running (I've never been able to break a sub-25min 5k for the past TEN YEARS, but mainly because I've been lazy and not put enough effort into it)

I've noticed something odd about the way I run - my gait changes depending on how fast I go, and because of this, I find running at slightly higher speeds MUCH more difficult. 

Is it normal for your ""gait"" to change as you get faster?  The reason I ask, is that at the moment, I'm quite unfit, so I'm forcing myself to run slower in order to keep my heart rate from shooting up, and also so I can focus on increasing my mileage (currently at around 7km per run, but I want to get this higher before I focus on increasing speed)

When I run slowly, I tend to not leave the ground for very long, and I sort of look like I'm shuffling along, whereas as I get faster, I look more like a ""runner"" in that my legs are lifting higher.  But when I do that I get much more tired and my heart rate shoots up, so it seems less efficient...

Is this normal, or should I focus on using the correct gait no matter what the speed?  I do fear that my gait is holding me back as I've been told in the past that a) I run like a donkey and b) I run like a penguin...",Running gait vs speed question,lee_the_man,1609249181,2020-12-29 13:39:41

I've been running for the last 4 years or so, a fair few 10kms and half marathons mostly, my best time is a half in 1hr 44mins a couple of years ago, I'm 38 and I feel like I've got better half times and full marathons in my legs.

In 2021 with the lack of races to train for,  I'd really like to find some consistency in my miles per week. I'm aiming to run around 20/25 miles per week and see how I get on. However with my job being quite busy at times, I think running in the morning is the best option for me.

Do you run before work in the morning?  If so, what is your routine? Do you just get up and go, or do you sit and have a coffee and wake up first? Do you warm up in the house first? I'll probably test out all of these, but any advice from all you Reddit Seasoned Runners would be welcome! 😁

running,"Hello all. 

5 weeks ago I slipped on some mud and landed on my ankle causing a bad sprain. I couldn’t walk without limping for a good few weeks. 

I can now walk fine, and I only have very minor pain in my Achilles when I really ‘extend’ my foot forward. It also feels kinda tight first thing in the morning but soon loosens up. 

I’m thinking it might be time soon to give it a test run, but with it being the first time I’ve injured myself in this way, I’m really not too sure how soon I should try and get back to it. 

I know most of you are not doctors and the advice I’ll probably be will be to go and see one. 

But I’m just looking to get the opinion of people who have recovered from sprains before in how soon I should hit the pavement again. Should I wait until there is no pain/tightness at all?

running,"A year go today I was reading this subreddit a few days out from the new year and mention came up of how novel the opportunity to run every day of a leap year was and that the chance was coming to hit that unique milestone.  I'm writing this now rather than in 2 days having completed the challenge as it took me a couple of days to psych myself up to the idea of the challenge and someone reading this might have just enough time to get their headspace right to take on 2021 in a similar capacity.

My background as a runner is of one who would be at the tail end of the recreational runners doing a half marathon. I had never run a single km in my life until the novelty of the Nike+ running app on my first iPhone I got when I was 27 made me give it a go and a year later I ran my first half in a little over 2 hours (I'm 38 yrs now).  Last year I ran a total of 279kms and actually didn't run a single day in the December leading in to this years challenge.

One of the biggest but possibly less obvious hurdles in completing a challenge such as running 366 days in a row is getting buy in and support from your family for the unforgiving time commitment involved, most days my run would take 10 minutes building up to get gear on, 30 minutes of running, 20 minutes of cooling down and 10 minutes for a shower afterwards.  That's an easy 60 minutes of disruption every day that I had to get past my wife, so for her understanding I am very appreciative of that.

I set my personal goal to run a minimum of 2km a day as I don't do miles and 1km didn't  sound like a real run while I felt I could do 2km in some capacity even  if under the weather.  I've averaged a little over 4km so far these  first 364 days of the year and look to pass the 1500km mark on Thursday.

Running  while unwell I've been lucky to only have a serious cold/fever on two  occasions that I had to push through, 3 migraines that caused partial  vision issues were a little rougher to manage and I was able to rest a  few hours in a dark room first then make it out.  I fell on one night  time run grazing a knee and my hands but with no real damage and just  last week twisted my ankle tripping down the stairs in the dark but  managed to shake that one off too.

Mostly  I've run at night time, anywhere from 6pm-11pm.  My headlamp of choice  is a Black Diamond Sprinter as it has a blinking red light on the back  as well as full illumination upfront making me feel safer running on the  roads.

I've  found the tracking from the web app Smashrun which I got on to from the  posts I saw here last year fantastic motivation for maintaining the  streak and following my improvements.  This app imports runs I record  using my old Garmin FR235.

Sometimes  I'd run as many as 10 days in a row doing my bare minimum 2k as a bit  of a recovery from a more intense or disrupted period, other times It'd  be the other way around and I'd do 10 days of 5k+ each day.  My biggest  month was October with 200kms in the month.

Starting  out just seeing if I could do 30 days in a row then 100 was quite  exciting.  Knowing past that point it would be to throw away the streak  and have to start over has psychologically been the right fit for me  (and in the case of a leap year challenge in particular require a 3+  year reset period).

I've had a history of calf and achilles injuries so I had to really listen to my body and ease down on the speed at the times I felt I was pushing my limits.  I feel that this years training has really built a resilience in both my body and mind which has been a great bonus to the whole endeavour.

My  first 5k of the year I had a pace of 7:25 per km with an average heart  rate of 188, whereas yesterdays 5k I had a page of 5:57 per km and an  average heart rate of 166 which demonstrates I think some pretty solid  gains over the period.  I'll be the first to admit I'm a heavier runner  at 113kgs, I haven't focussed on diet this year to any great extent but  feel I can make some changes there too.  I did however manage to go the  whole year without alcohol or caffeine which may seem to some to be more  extreme than the running streak even.

TLDR;   I've found the goal of a running streak for a whole year to be  enjoyable and rewarding, but it is definitely a challenge that requires a commitment and compromises to make it work.  I'm going to see if I can carry the streak on to 500 days and beyond, but am considering the possibility of breaking it for a little balance and to take on some other goals while still running at least 5+ days a week.",Lessons learned from a year of running inspired by r/running,nbly,1609232013,2020-12-29 08:53:33

running,"This has been happening since I ran the 800 meters in 8th grade (intro to running) up until now (12th grade), so I'm guessing it's normal? I've been to cardiologists just to be safe, and everything comes back perfectly fine, saying I have a very healthy heart. Eventually I concluded that this is normal with exertion, since it doesn't happen (or happens only slightly) during most of my easier/moderate runs. But I still have my doubts. I've googled, but none of the heart or lung conditions really fit what I experienced. 

I don't have asthma, and this isn't really a breathing issue. Sure, I'm breathing heavily by the end of a race, but for me, it's the chest/lung discomfort that starts way before the leg discomfort. During the last mile of a 10k race, I feel this tight pain centered around my chest area that makes it increasingly harder to push through. Whether it be me pumping through the final stretch of a track workout, a 10k,   or a steep hill, I always feel it. Hot or cold weather; doesn't matter. Feels the same. Even happens when I'm swimming, nordic ski racing, or biking (uphill usually) really intensely. 

I'm pretty sure this is normal when athletes push themselves. I mean that's why nordic skiers collapse at the end of a race, right? What makes me frustrated, is that I have never been able to describe this pain/discomfort very well. Luckily, it doesn't seem to be accompanied by other symptoms. Well, actually, by the end of a hilly 5k, my arms will be aching, but I don't think this is anything alarming to worry about; hopefully not. Sometimes the pain will spread down to my stomach. But not often. 

Stupid question, but during a race or workout where you're really pushing yourself, where do you feel discomfort? Legs? Lungs? Stomach? Both? What does it feel like? I'm pretty sure what I'm feeling is normal race fatigue. I mean I'm not supposed to feel energetic coming down the finish line, but I just want to make sure I'm not going to pass out.

So what happened was in school, during pe we had to pair up with someone meaning there were 15 teams of two,and we had to spread out forming a circle.then our teacher stood in the middle and threw a tennis ball in the air at each pair, we had to catch it and then throw it back and take a lap around the circle we had formed as he throws it to the next then they take a lap so on and so forth.

Then as it was coming to the end and I was the last man standing,he threw it to the spot I was meant to be in and everything was black fading and I couldn’t breath, but something inside me just lit up and I sprinted even though a second ago I was stumbling a while lap around all the people and caught the ball leading me to win. 

It felt as though the ball froze in the air and I ran faster than ever before, but it was still slow motion. After I finished everyone rushed to me and started screaming because I managed to catch the ball but I was finished and slumped. What is this feeling called? And how do I achieve this again?

running,"Tldr: Are my zero-drop shoes the problem or do I need to just strengthen and stretch my calves while I slow down my training program? 

Hi all! I'm new to running (running for about 4-5 months). I started off using zero-drop shoes, mainly on accident, but I prefer them over shoes with drop and cushion. When I was in high-school I ran barefoot/with barefoot shoes, and I normal walk around barefoot or in flat shoes anyways, so the further I got into training and research of new shoes, the more I leaned towards sticking with zero drop shoes. Also, I've always ran striking with the pad/mid-foot, so I wasn't concerned about a lot of the common injuries that come with zero-drop because I don't heel strike. 

I trained for a 10k and completed a race in November. All of my training went well and I was comfortable the whole time. I did the race on about an hour and 10 minutes (just for reference for later). After the race, I was ready to move on to a new goal: a half marathon. I increased my disrance way too fast and I ended up with gigantic blisters which caused me to take some time off. I biked and walked for a week, then started my training plan again, but slower.

Things were going well for about two weeks, but then my ankles started to hurt like crazy. I think it was because I started doing 13-15k runs on Saturdays with heavy elevation. It felt like I couldn't lower my foot all the way when I was running. I know that I pronate a little, so I thought maybe it was that, but it started getting so bad that my easy 5k runs hurt as well.

I went to physical therapist, but I'm in another country, so it was difficult trying to explain everything and understand everything. He told me that my calves were overcharged and we're ""blocking"" my ankles causing pain. He did electrotherapy and massaged them, then sent me home with calf stretches and exercises to strengthen them. He also told me that I needed to switch shoes to have more cushion.

I know I went to fast in my training program and I've slowed it down a lot. I'm only doing about 15k a week and at my slow pace (~6:40-7/km). I do my exercises/stretches two times a day while putting heat on them every once in awhile. It helps, but they still hurt, and I'm assuming they are going to take awhile to heal.

My question is this: do I need to change my shoes to have some drop or just be slower in my training while I strengthen my calves and ankles? I really prefer zero-drop/shoes with less cushion because I feel that I have more control over myself and I would like to be able to keep them, but I don't want to do that at the expense of my health.","Pushed myself too hard while and now have pain in my inner ankles.

&gt;Background:   
&gt;  
&gt;I'm male, 30, 5'7', 150lbs. I'm decently fit in general, body fat percentage isn't high, I lift weights and do cardio as frequently as I can manage. I practice MMA and grappling at an advanced skill level.   
&gt;  
&gt;I've been running off and on for about a year now, nothing too serious. Two months ago I ran a 10k in 70 min while only breathing through my nose - nice and easy. I try not to push it too hard, knowing that most endurance is built at lower heart rate zones.   
&gt;  
&gt;I try to run at a pace that I can maintain easy nose breathing. Usually like 10-10:30/mile pace. I'm trying to build an aerobic base more than anything, as I didn't do any athletics when I was younger, and most of my training for grappling or weight lifting is more explosive power rather than steady state cardio. My personal goal now is to improve my long distance running.

Using my new heart rate monitor, I went for an easy run, and noticed that, even at a lower pace than normal, my heart rate was around 170 bpm. When just walking, it was around 140. Physically I felt pretty fine, I wasn't struggling, everything was kind of normal.

The heart rate monitor appears to be functioning correctly, as I also checked my heart rate using other methods.

I'm not sure what my maximum heart rate is, I never tested it, and my resting heart rate is usually 55-58. I suspect this new medication is increasing my heart rate a decent amount. 

For endurance, supposedly I want to train in a lower heart rate zone. Apparently, when I go jogging, my heart rate is pretty high, although I am not straining or breathing heavily.

If I go for a light, long distance run, and my heart rate is in the red zone, am I still training for endurance? Is my endurance hindered by taking stimulants?

The sidewalks are pretty old and uneven, so there isn't much running traffic nearmy place, which is fine with me, since I'm a pretty self conscious runner (slow and not in great shape), and prefer to avoid crossing paths when I can.

There is one very small woman with very large hair I would always see sprinting down the big, hilly road by my apartment almost every day without fail at lunch time. She is always BOOKING IT and it's pretty hard to not notice her and all of her gorgeous hair. You can tell just by looking at her that she is serious running business.  Seeing her really inspired me to keep running in the mornings and evenings. 

I'm almost done with Couch to 5k (should finish it this week)! And since I'm on break, I get to jog during the daytime which is very nice. I was 2/3rds of the way through my longest run yet on the program, slogging uphill, and lo and behold, I see Big Hair Running Lady come towards me!! The sidewalk is very narrow, so I was getting into the grass while she was getting onto the street. She saw me and her face lit up and we waved like we were long lost friends.

running,"Hi everyone,

I am planning to run a half-marathon in 5 months and wanted to get advice on how to train for it. More specifically I wanted to know

1. what should my target time be for a HM based on the background info below? Would love sub 1h30 but not sure how realistic given current condition and 5 month timeline
2. based on the reply to 1. any particular training plan that you would recommend?

Some background info: 

* 28M, always exercised but only started running seriously in April this year
* Ran approx 1200km since April (about 30km/week), almost exclusively Z2 training (estimated using Maffetone, with HR in low 150's) with an occasional ""tempo"" run. Entirely aware I am missing speed work / intervals / etc, but was mostly running for fun as opposed to following an actual program (and justified it by telling myself I was base building anyways).
* I haven't really run any races or 'all-in' efforts this year, but would estimate my 5k PR around 21-22mns and my 10k around 45-46mns at peak form (sometime around August this year). With some structured training, think I would be able to hit a sub 20 5k relatively quickly. To give you further metrics I have, my usual Z2 runs at 150bpm average are now at a pace of around 5'45mn/km (much much slower in April) and my last comfortably-hard-but-not-all-in run was a 10k in 48mns at 181bpm HR average.
* I measure HR using a Polar H10, and my max is around 204-205 (no lab testing, just tried on a treadmill).

I’m following all advice and running slow and building up. But why isn’t my heart rate in the normal 140-160 range? I might be going “too fast,” but I literally can’t run any slower (I’d end up walking).

Am I hitting an aerobic/anaerobic threshold? Is that why I’m getting out of breath? Is it because my legs are too weak? I don’t understand where I’m going wrong here.

I set my goal to run a sub 18 3 mile for a physical test that I will partake in if I decide to join the military.

So my dumbass went at it with the complete bioscience approach and worked my way up to running 3 miles 5x a week from the beginning of April to the end of July. Then from the end of July to the end of September I ran 3 miles 5x a week thinking I would somehow reach my goal. My best 3 mile time was at 19:58 during that period. I am pretty disappointed in myself because I know I could have done better but thats why I am here to ask for some advice. So I did more research and came up with a new routine starting from October. This is what I have been doing since the beginning of October.

**Mon:** 2 miles at 5K pace

**Tues:** 2 miles (1600m x 2) 3:00 rest in between sets

**Wed:** 2 mile (800m x 4) 1:30 rest in between sets

**Thurs:** 2 mile (400m x 8) 0:45 rest in between sets

**Fri:** REST

**Sat:** 6 miles at 8 min/mi 

**Sun:** 6 miles at 8 min/mi 

Total of 20 miles/wk

running,"Hi all. Recently I read advice about training according to heart rate zones and I am a bit confused about how the % relate to perceived effort levels. 

The best example of this is my most recent 21.1 km, which I did in 1hr 40min (4:46 pace, 23F 51kg), and according to my heart rate monitor and a heart rate zones app I downloaded, my average intensity for the whole thing was 92%! So the highest zone possible which according to what I’ve read should equal maximum effort, unable to talk, etc... but it certainly didn’t feel that way when I was running, it was a sustained effort but I didn’t sprint and would have been able to talk a little, and my pace was reasonably consistent (4:25-5:00 min/km). The zones are corrected for my higher max heart rate (206 bpm) so I can only assume the math is correct.

All my runs are similar, I don’t think I’ve ever dipped even into zone 3, although I will admit I often push myself (although I know I shouldn’t!) on the shorter runs so that does make more sense. But the longer distances are always a sustained, strong but steady pace, and yet I’m still always avg 185+ bpm.

running,"Okay so a bit of background about the surgery first. I’m in my mid/late twenties, last year I had bunion surgery on my right foot which was a hereditary problem, my joint was always painful and my middle toe kept mysteriously bruising up (probably from taking on the majority of the motion). The first surgery failed and was over corrected (probably had something to do with my naturally flexible joints), so in February this year I had a soft tissue release and a bone graft put in place to stop the toe bone from slipping off the joint. The second surgery again wasn’t successful as my body had absorbed the donor bone and the bone slipped off the joint and my big toe was left pointing outwards at an extreme angle. Finally, in July I had a 1st MTP fusion (big toe joint fusion) and my surgeon was happy with the last set of X-rays.

While I’m much of an experienced runner, I ran as a hobby for some exercise in bouts before the surgeries wearing just a regular pairs of running trainers. My surgeon assured me that I’d be able to run with the fused toe but it will take a bit of time getting used to.

I’m looking for some tips/advices on how to get started with running again and finding it quite difficult to search online as most articles refer to arthritis related issues. Are there any known “methods” of running when there is little movement in the toe that doesn’t cause further pain up towards the ankle or any recommended shoes to help supporting this?

running,"Like, obviously it's not for someone who can't finish a 5k, but how big of a base do you think it needs?  I want to try it, but I don't want to start something I'm not ready for.  For reference, I've been running consistently since May.  In the beginning, I couldn't run 200m without being gassed.  A long life of drinking, smoking, and horrible diet choices will do that to you.  Also, I had just moved across the country and had minor surgery (gall bladder, which got botched and required some follow-up care), but it still kept me away from anything remotely cardio related for a couple months.

I built up slowly and this month will be my first 100 mile month (should hit 120 on the 31st).  Was in the 90's the last 2 months and I've been at 20+ mile weeks since mid-October.  Currently, I'm doing 5k's on M/T/Th/F, either 5 miles or a 10k on Wed, depending on how much time I have, and I'm up to 10 miles on my Sat run.  I feel like I can push that one further, but haven't really tried yet.  I kind of never feel any different from mile 3 on as long as I keep that really slow 11:30-12:00 mile pace going.  Just kind of letting the momentum carry me until it's time to stop.  

I haven't really had any injuries other than the startings of shin splints in early Nov, which kept me from hitting 100 last month, but I took a few days off and have kept my pace pretty slow since then and it really hasn't bothered me after the first 10 days or so.

running,"Basically, I'm a size 10/10.5, and I've somehow fallen in love with running in a pair of size 12 Nike Revolution 4.

However, when I get back from a run, no matter how short, I need a days recovery at minimum to allow my shin to stop causing shooting pains when I run. I don't believe this is a shin splint, as the pain is caused when I run and for about half an hour after I stop, but I could quite happily stamp my feet on hard ground after that without causing any real discomfort.

I suppose my first question would be, could shoes that are too big and not all that brilliant cause this kind of pain, or am I going to get the same sort of pain but lesser with a well fitted and premium pair of running shoes.

Secondly, I am caught between two pairs at the moment:

Hoka One One Clifton 7

On Cloudstratus

The price difference for me is irrelevant. If the Cloudstratus is ever so slightly better, then I'm happy to pay the difference. 

My main goals with running are to cover medium to long distances (my current stamina allows for a 7K run on a really good day, but I'm out of shape and new to running, so I would be looking to get up to regular 10K runs multiple times a week)

My knees aren't great, and do often hurt from day to day, although never really when I run. More when I have to apply a fair amount of weight to them.

The Cloudstratus drew my attention because of its focus on cushioning and stability, and I like the look of them. When I asked my friend, a distance runner who clears 80K+ a week about them, he said they were relatively expensive for what they provided, and a pair of Clifton 7's would do the same job for a little less money.

To me, it seems that the Clifton 7's are cushioned well, but also designed to be light and speedy. I would like for the shoes I buy to keep me comfortable and healthy at long distance/moderate pace. I am not interested in speed work or racing, it's just not my thing.

Can anyone please give me some advice? I don't have the opportunity to try either pair really, so making my own mind up throught first hand experience would be difficult.

running,"I've got my third marathon booked in for April and I can't find a training plan that suits my needs which has left me wondering what to do.
Currently, I run 30-40 miles per week with my long run day every Sunday, it's my favourite run of the week because I can get lost in my thoughts. The run can be anywhere between 13 to 20 miles. 
The problem I'm facing is I don't really want to start a three month training plan and drop my mileage for the first six weeks or so, due to the enjoyment I get out of my long runs. 
I'm definitely not ready for an advanced plan, I'm not the quickest runner, my last marathon was 4:08 and I'm hoping that I can get under the 4 hour mark in April (I'm quietly confident I will).
What do you guys recommend? Could burn out be an issue? Or do I keep running my usual long runs but as I get closer to the marathon just aim for more 20 milers rather than 13? TIA",Marathon training plan - do I drop the mileage?,RedRoseRunner,1609119344,2020-12-28 01:35:44

It’s no exaggeration to say the entire time I’m running I’m either going up a hill or down a hill.  Every single run that I do is basically a fartlek of varying intensity.

When I try to do a base run in Z2 the only way I can remain in that zone is to run/walk (and mostly walk) up the hills, and I just ping pong back and forth between Z3 and the lower third of Z2 as I either run or walk.

Then on flip side when I try to do a threshold run in Z4 I’m doing well to stay even in Z3 when going down the hills. And mostly I’m afraid I’m going to injure myself barreling down these hills.

just some stuff about me.. and my justification as to why I feel like 10k a day is not that dangerous in terms of injury potential/shin splints etc

I (M25) 5.10 89kg (broad/endomorph?), 

I was 125kg last year, and now I'm at 89kg, Ive walked 800-1000km every month from 09/19-09/20 (my job), and since September Ive started a new job and I've started running from work, its 10km from my home to work.. and as I've started my running time has decreased  from 1hr-10-1h15 to 55-60mins in the space of 2 months, I've gone from never running in my life (I was a big boi who'd be out of breath from stairs...) to being able to run 10-20km with no problems 

i understand that excessive running can cause injury, but I feel like Ive strengthened my legs up enough over the year to have at-least increased my upper limit for injury. some weeks I'd walk 50+km a day 5 days in a row, it was difficult at first but I adapted quickly.

running,"I use this shoe almost exclusively for track workouts. Amazing feel underfoot, really helps to get up to target pace during tempos and interval workouts. \~50 miles ran in them, most of it is track work

Weight: At 5.7 oz in a US size 9 (I wear 8.5), you feel like you're not holding anything in your hands. Super light, really helps with the turnover rate since it's not your standard trainer which can feel blocky at faster paces. 

Upper: A coated mesh which really holds its shape well. I've used it for races too, but workouts where you're constantly changing pace really shows how it locks your foot in. Pebax heel counter really helps with it too. 

Insole: Minimal, not much to say. Would not recommend replacing or adding to the insole in the shoe, it is firm for a reason: speed. 

Midsole: The HyperBurst line from Skechers is really really responsive, and this line is working with something called M-Strike, which encourages a midfoot landing especially during workouts where speed and efficiency is key. There is also an exposed plate visible through the outsole made of nylon, and is what distinguishes this from a race day shoe (at least in my experience). 

Outsole: The Goodyear rubber outsole works pretty well to grip wet roads, but wet tracks are probably the biggest issue with this shoe. As long as you're on the road, or there is not excessive water, you should be okay. 

Overall Review: I give this shoe an 9/10. It is a very versatile shoe, bringing me through workouts from repeat 400s all the way to 4 mile tempos. While I can mostly speak of its performance on the track, which is exceptional, its road performance is also very solid. I have also raced in them in cross country on a particularly rocky course, and it holds its own. It is a very aggressive trainer, not for easy days, hence the lack of real mileage on them.

running,"When British long-distance runner and gold medallist Mo Farah failed to qualify the 5000 metres final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics — an event he calls the biggest disappointment of his career — he took stock of everything and began changing his lifestyle.

Farah uprooted himself from Britain, where he had been living since he was 8 years old, leaving his wife, Tania Nell and twin daughters, and moved to Kenya for a training camp in preparation for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

“I could easily have stayed in the UK with my family in a nice house, but I was willing to take a risk,” he told RadioTimes. Though it was missing the comforts of his home and family, the training camp in Kenya enabled Farah to totally focus on his goal.

“My room is basic: a bed, no TV. I wake up, run, have breakfast, sleep, gym in the afternoon, another run in the evening,” he said, describing his daily routine in Kenya. “That’s it, nothing else. No going to the café, no going for coffee. I just eat, sleep and train. When you get out on the roads and trails, there are big groups of locals running everywhere. They all run with great hunger. They know if they don’t, their families don’t eat.”

The lifestyle change paid off. Farah captured four gold medals in total at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events, and has gone on to become one the most successful British track athletes in modern Olympic Games history.

On a typical training day, Farah wakes up between 7-7.30am, and has breakfast — he loves his coffee and cereal, in particular Frosties, “they gave me my much needed sugar rush to get me through the early part of each day,” he told The BBC. On other days he’ll have a couple pieces of toast with Nutella.

A little background (more detail below): I started running on my own around fall of 2015, then the following year I started running high school cross country and did that for 4 years. Now I'm a college freshman and I've been running a bit on my own, and while it was nice to have no set goal for a while, I'm starting to feel motivation slipping away from me. 

Here's more detail: 

* 2015: started running, ran my first ever 5k
* 2016: trained over the summer for my freshman xc season
* 2017: trained, had a fantastic soph season
* 2018: ran my first 10k in the spring, then overtrained through the summer and got a stress reaction forcing me to sit out for most of my junior season
* 2019: came back stronger and ever so slightly faster for an injury free senior season
* 2020: running consistently 3x a week since June (total of 8-10 miles weekly)

So, I can comfortably do 4-5 miles right now, the most I've done in a single run is 7, my 5k PR is 24:02, best mile is 7 flat, and best 400m is somewhere around 1:26. With no races in sight, I'm not sure whether I should work on speed or distance, or where to go from here.

But where should I punch in the treadmill runs to keep an overview of total distance, and where should I track the distance on the shoes? 

I think it is a bit much to add runs manually to Garmin and then upload to Strava. Should I just use Strava as my main log and put them in there? But Garmin is more comprehensive, no?

What do you guys do?

running,"About me: F, early 20s, 114lb, active 3-5 days a week depending on my schedule 

I've been running more or less consistently for the past 1.5 years (full time nursing school + work means I want to spend all my free time being lazy!!) and did some weight lifting before that. Since lockdown I've been running way more consistently and seen improvement, but I still feel like I'm not where I should be and the improvement is sooo slow. It is of note that I have POTS (I'm cleared to run) and running has really improved my symptoms, but it may be a contributing factor, hard to say. 

When I run, my limiting factor is always my cardiovascular system. My legs seem to never tire out. I can run a mile and some change without stopping and most of my runs now are between 3-5 miles, but usually 3 because I'm often pooped at that point. During these runs I still have to take walking breaks before I can continue running and it's *so frustrating*. I try to run slowly (11-12 min/mile slow) most of my run and not get overzealous. Even when I'm running 11:30/mile I still find myself needing to walk a block after 0.4 miles or so. I read so many posts in this sub from people talking about how awful they are at running because their mile time is only 8 min, or people who started running 6 months ago and are now doing 10Ks-- it makes me feel frustrated with how much I'm struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

My runs usually look like this: run first mile at a very easy pace, then the next 2-3 miles I try to run as much of it as possible but take walk breaks if I need to until I can catch my breath. I've been throwing in some brief intervals at a faster pace throughout my runs for \~spice\~. I know running very consistently is important and that I'm not the best at this, I strive for 3-5 days a week.

running,"I started running just over a year ago. Due to pressure at work and home I run approx 2.6 - 3km at a stretch 3 days a week; no more but on rare occasions I've done 4. Throughout the year I've racked up just under 480km. I do about 5.8 min/km - 7.1min/km

At first glance this seems ok but I have two issues:

The main one is that occasionally I can't get past the 1km without stopping and walking because I'm out of breath or I have a stitch in my stomach. I'm not even 40, don't drink, never smoked, don't do any drugs, not on medication.

On the flip side, I don't have the best diet. I like desserts, skip breakfast often to keep my weight in check. Struggle to drink more water than I should. Don't eat a lot of vegetables. I avoid beef even though I love burgers. Pork products are difficult to avoid where I live and I love chicken. I do have fish once in awhile. I do have a lot of wheat products whereas rice and quinoa rarely.

Every other day I do some form of calisthenics: push ups, pull ups, crunches.

The other issue I have is that I cannot get past the 3km at a stretch mark. I think it's related to the first one. But if I struggle 3km without stopping how do I get to 3.5 and beyond?

Maybe mention your goals/distance that way other posters can jump on your post and I'll send them the same plan so more people can benefit?

My pb's (don't laugh) are 29 mins 5k, 61 mins 10k and 2.20 half -from about 10 years ago (Bad mental health kind of messed up a decade of my life).  The most consistent I've been was the 16 weeks before my second half which peaked at about 20 miles for the week which is roughly when all my pb's happened.  Consistency has always been my downfall. Looking back, the depression that was already there didn't help matters.

Anyhow, I'm just back on the running wagon and my depression is drug controlled and I've been doing really well mentally for the past year in particular.  I've booked a couple of 10ks, a half and an October marathon for 2021, covid permitting,  for motivation and I'm starting at 3 miles a day running 30 days straight after which I'll drop to 6 days per week.

I have always know that I had a problem with severe cramping in my side, but I assumed it was just because I was out of shape. Now, after working out and doing intense biking for a year, I think it's something else entirely.

I still get an incredibly painful cramp on both sides of my torso extending from below my stomach to right under my ribs about two minutes into a run. It's not just about exercise either. I am an avid biker and often go for intense multiple hour rides with no problems at all. As soon as I get off and jog a bit, though, I will be doubled over in pain.

I have tried strictly managing hydration and nutrition for the day, not eating for three hours before a run, working out intercostal muscles, long stretching and warmup routines, different breathing patterns, and improving posture.

The only strategy I have found that works is doing wind sprints. The cramp has not set on by the time I am exhausted and the little seed of a cramp goes away over the rest period. I hate having to employ that strategy though. 

I assume the problem lies with sensitivity to impacts, but I have not heard anybody with advice on how to mitigate this issue. It's a real problem for me as a lot of my mental health comes from my daily outdoor bike ride and, due to my location, it is infeasible to bike in the winter.

Would this be classed more of a 50/50 split, as the long run is not a true easy pace, or would it be more of an 80/20 split as the long run is still very much below threshold?

But by week 5 my knee started giving me trouble. So, I went down to 4 days a week of running. Guess going from 3 to 6 days all at once was too much. Things were ok on 4 days a week of cadence but I did still miss a few days of running for other reasons. Here is the [schedule]( https://imgur.com/a/RYbTCUS) I followed from May to September. Red means I skipped that run completely for one reason or another. 


In September SoCal apparently caught on fire so I had to throw any plans out the window… I ran whenever I could. Tried to go back to treadmill but honestly that’s really difficult to go back to. With minimal running and no weightlifting, I got tired of not exercising and bought a rack, barbell, and some weights. It was expensive but I don't regret it. I always wanted a home gym anyways. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/p6tkXzY) it is ready for action! As the air quality started clearing up, I combined very light weights with some running. But overall, my good habits with running were mostly ruined so I decided to give myself a new goal: complete a half marathon! 


I got the half marathon plan from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gcwdq6/update_final_i_will_write_you_a_free_running_plan/) and started following the beginner plan. This got me back on track pretty well. The beginner plan has me running 5 days a week. I also became consistent in my weightlifting efforts. 


Weightlifting was also 5 days a week following the philosophy from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/). My plan is [here]( https://imgur.com/a/lx03auL). I mostly just worried about T1 and T2 exercises. I still can’t really do ring dips so I just stay at the top position for as long as I can. It has been working well; I started super low on all lifts and I’m just now approaching my previous numbers. I run in the morning before work and do weightlifting in the evening after work. It seems to work pretty well without tiring me too much.


Today is the end of week 7 for the HM plan. I did the 10K TT yesterday and finished in 01:08:44.700. This was my best 10K time by over 10 minutes. This also improves my 5K time from 35:20 to 33:00. I was running the first half mostly uphill and the second half mostly downhill… so my true 5K is probably a little slower than 33:00. Still, I’m very happy with this. Here is my 10K TT [data]( https://imgur.com/a/OO8XK0x). Initially I was hoping to just complete HM in under 3 hours. But maybe I can get to 2:30:00 now? Would be nice to try. 


**2020 Overall**  
1 Mile PR – 0:09:57  
5K PR – 0:33:00  
10K PR – 1:08:44  
Total miles: 670 miles  


**2021 Goals**  
1Mile PR – 0:09:00  
5K PR – 0:30:00  
10K PR – 1:00:00  
HM PR – 2:30:00  
Total miles: 1000 miles


Don’t know how realistic these goals are but I want to try. After my first HM attempt in January, I’ll try to follow the other training plans provided by the same person who provided the HM plan. Go from 1 Mile to 5KM to 10KM advanced plans.

running,"My stats: 
28F, 5ft 4 (162cm), 54kg (119lbs), BMI of 20.3, Scotland. I walk 45 minutes 4 days per week with my dog.

My goal:
I was 47kg 2 years ago. I was bordering on being underweight (not deliberately. I’ve always been thin) and was recommended to put on 3kg. I accidentally put on 7kg and I now want to get down from 54kg to 51kg. 
As well, as losing a small about of weight, I want to lead a healthier, happier lifestyle where I can be proud of myself instead of watching tv all day. 

So far:
Out of the blue, I did a bleep test with my husband just over 1 week ago and did terribly (4.5). I had a wake up call and decided to start running, cut my calories from the ~2,400 I was eating a day. 
As you can see below, I then did too much too quickly and developed sore hip flexors. 
My week looked like this:
Sat - bleep test (4.5)
Sun - 2.5k trail run (with 7 stops for body weight exercises)
Mon - a 5k run
Tues - 5k run
Wed - rest day
Thurs - bleep test again (6.0)
Fri - 2.5k trail run again
Sat - rest day (Boxing Day)
TODAY - best effort 5k (34:36). 

I’ve learned I need to take it a bit easier with the running until my body gets more used to it. 

My plan: 
- 1 best effort 5k per week
- 3 30-minute light jogs per week
- 1 2.5k trail run (with body weight exercises) per week
- 1 body weight strength session
- 1 rest day per week
I will also be walking my dog for 45 minutes per day 4 days per week
I am also doing 20 minutes of stretching per day (mainly to target my tight hip muscles)

I’m just looking for some feedback or thoughts on any of the above. My goal, as I mentioned, isn’t to get better at running so I can compete, but just to get healthier and lose (then maintain) a small amount of weight. 

I would also appreciate any suggestions unrelated to my goal/exercise plan, like any kit suggestions etc. I have proper Salomon trail running shoes and am considering getting an Apple Watch to monitor aspects of my fitness and exercise. I currently use the Nike Run Club app, but I have to hold my phone in my hand while I run...

Also, I know this might be silly, but I’m a bit apprehensive about ‘long’ runs such as 6 miles or more as I don’t want to end up skinnier than I am. Is there a way that can be avoided or is it (like I suspect) just a results of using more calories?

I'm a fan of cycling far more than running, but due to neck pains, I can't endure sitting for 1-1h30 on a saddle. I figured until I got that problem out of the way, I should opt for another type of accessible endurance training, running.

Now I do know that both cycling and running increase your aerobic capacity, VO2max and all that jazz, but is all of that sufficient to maintain the endurance I've gained for cycling *specifically*?

**I feel like cycling requires, along one's general capacity, endurance in the quads punctually, and since running doesn't really work them out that much I'll end up losing that.** I won't be able run up those hills anymore. :'(

running,"Hey fellow runners! 😍 This is my first reddit post ever so bear with me. 

I'm two months into recovering from my first ever running injury (sigh), L sided posterior tibialis tendonitis. For reference, I'm a whopping 26 y/o F, 5'1"" 115 lbs.

It happened mid October. This year I kicked my running frequency up to 5 days a week starting in March, because as a COVID nurse here in the US, there weren't/aren't many activities I felt/feel comfortable doing. 

 - Mondays were distance days (10-13.2 miles)
- Tuesdays were recovery days (2.5-4 miles)
- Wednesday were speed training days (intervals for 4.5 miles or tempo for 3 miles)
- Thursdays were also recovery days (2.5-4 miles)
- Fridays were intermittently recovery or short speed training (usually 2-2.5 miles) 

I figured the injury would go away on it's own with rest from running, new OTC insoles, ibuprofen, and ice. However, when it came to early December with seemingly no change to the pain/severity, I went to see an orthopedic MD who confirmed my suspicion of my posterior tibialis tendonitis. They gave me an offloading boot to wear through the end of the year with my follow up on Dec 31st. Since then, the boot has seemingly exacerbated the pain/swelling, and so I'm scheduled for an MRI the day before my follow up. 

Needless to say, I'm getting impatient with all of this waiting. I haven't gone this long without running since probably 2013, and I'm losing my mind a little! 
With running being my source of stress relief, energy, mindfulness since the start of college, you could say I've been in mourning 😆 

Not sure of the exact purpose of this post but I suppose I'm looking for a space to vent where people can relate, pro tips / experiences from recovered runners that experienced posterior tibialis tendonitis (or other relevant injuries), as well as suggestions for activities/workouts to do to stay in shape physically/mentally until I (hopefully) return again to running some day.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/p6tkXzY) it is ready for action! As the air quality started clearing up, I combined very light weights with some running. But overall, my good habits with running were mostly ruined so I decided to give myself a new goal: complete a half marathon! 


I got the half marathon plan from here and started following the beginner plan. https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gcwdq6/update_final_i_will_write_you_a_free_running_plan/


This got me back on track pretty well. The beginner plan has me running 5 days a week. I also became consistent in my weightlifting efforts. 


Weightlifting was also 5 days a week following the philosophy from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/). My plan is [here]( https://imgur.com/a/lx03auL). I mostly just worried about T1 and T2 exercises. I still can’t really do ring dips so I just stay at the top position for as long as I can. It has been working well; I started super low on all lifts and I’m still progressing on them all. I run in the morning before work and do weightlifting in the evening after work.


Today is the end of week 7 for the HM plan. I did the 10K TT and finished in 01:08:44.700. This was my best 10K time by over 10 minutes. This also improves my 5K time from 35:20 to 33:00. I was running the first half mostly uphill and the second half mostly downhill… so my true 5K is probably a little slower than 33:00. Still, I’m very happy with this. Here is my 10K TT [data]( https://imgur.com/a/OO8XK0x). Initially I was hoping to just complete HM in under 3 hours. But maybe I can get to 2:30:00 now? Would be nice to try.


**2020 Overall**  
1 Mile PR – 0:09:57  
5K PR – 0:33:00  
10K PR – 1:08:44  
Total miles: 670 miles  


**2021 Goals**  
1Mile PR – 0:09:00  
5K PR – 0:30:00  
10K PR – 1:00:00  
HM PR – 2:30:00  
Total miles: 1000 miles


Don’t know how realistic these goals are but I want to try. After my first HM attempt in January, I’ll try to follow the other training plans provided by the same person who provided the HM plan. Go from 1 Mile to 5KM to 10KM advanced plans.

running,"**Background:** I picked up running consistently during March and went at it for a good 5 months or so - 5 days a week of easy runs, around 25-30 mpw. But then in September I started a new job and moved, which ultimately led me to not running for the next four months (which I now deeply regret). I want to commit to picking the habit back up, and re-prioritizing it into my life. In 2021 I'm hoping to focus on the mile and improving my time as much as possible.

I did a time trial today to see how much I've regressed, and ran 6:58 with pretty ugly splits: 1:31, 1:41, 1:48, 1:58. I know that time could be a lot better with more even splits, but it is what it is. Back in May I ran 6:00, and I'm confident I could get back to that level in a couple months with consistent training. But I wanted to ask y'all what a reasonable goal would be for the end of the year? 5:00 seems like a stretch, but would 5:30 be possible? 5:15?

running,"I think it's great that runners come in all shapes and sizes, and I'm not looking to do anything drastic or place too much emphasis on my weight. However, as I've gotten more serious, I often do wonder if my times would drop if I lost a few pounds and became lighter. 

I haven't been slowing down, but I haven't exactly improved (maybe slightly, but nothing really noticeable). I love running, and lately I've been motivated to get serious about setting goals and beating my times. In addition to upping mileage and incorporating certain workouts into my training, I've also considered looking at my nutrition. I eat pretty healthy overall and try to eat protein before and after long runs or workouts. I have a sweet tooth but I haven't felt like I needed to cut out desserts or unhealthy food. 

I'm a cross country runner (ran all seasons in high school, PR of 21:06, and might do high school track this spring). I definitely have a more muscular body type, but could probably lose some fat. I do feel heavier than other distance runners, and often feel awkward and heavy (not very light and graceful!) when racing in fast races. Maybe this isn't the right question for this subreddit, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with losing or gaining weight and impact on their running, or if anyone could help me find a good weight (whether it's maintaining or losing) to help reach my goals. 

I'm pretty short - around 5'3.5"" and weigh around 131 lbs. Probably have been here for 2 years. Most of the time, I know the number on the scale doesn't matter (I probably look a couple pounds less), but should I try to get into the 120-125 range again? Yes, feeling lighter would probably(?) make me faster, but I don't want to lose too much muscle.

To my dire shock, I ended up running MUCH slower today than my other days.

I've only been running since September. Since I live in Washington, it's dark when I start work and dark when I get off so generally I am forced to run in the dark. Tonight I started my run at 4:45, so the sun had set but it was still a little light. I ran through our neighborhood, turned onto the main road, and about 45 seconds later had a man hang out the car window and scream some profanity at me. I had headphones so I don't know exactly what he said but honestly it doesn't really matter. I was pretty spooked, I called my husband and we talked until I got home.

My endurance can do it pretty well, but man, were my feet and calves on fire. (3) On longer runs, you gotta worry about your nipples! By the finish, I was on fire.

running,"I don’t know who’s gonna read this, but about a month ago my last cross country race happened. I knew cross country was my first sport in high school, and I fell in love with it. It was actually my first organized sport ever, so it was all the more meaningful.

I joined cross country because my school didn’t cut from the team, meaning i could just join. I made some of my best friends in high school there during that team, and made lots of memories that some people forgot but I never really did. I wasn’t amazing either, but I did manage a 7:30 mile at the end of the season. 

My sophomore year, I took it a whole lot more seriously. I ended up skipping indoor freshman year, but outdoor was the season I really committed. My sophomore xc season was probably one of the most fun ones, as I improved drastically and even scored at the sophomore level. It was here that I realized this was my sport, along with indoor and outdoor track, for all of high school. 

My junior year, this was when I performed my best. Making the JV A team, I crushed the hills at Van Cortland and honestly enjoyed it. It was then that I realized I had big goals for the rest of my time, since I was halfway through high school. Goals in my events, from the 400 - mile. 

My senior year, which the season just finished, was bittersweet. I wasn’t hitting my times from last year, and I missed my season finale due to a quarantine because of exposure. But in my last race, before my quarantine, I gave it my all and then some. I’m proud to have run for my team, and I’m putting in that work for indoor. Even though I won’t be running with a team, I know I gave my all in the end. 

Well, if you’re still here, thank you. This has probably been the most important thing to me in all of high school, as it was something I could work towards for the whole time here. And here I am, training my way to my next indoor race, hoping to go sub 5 in the mile in January.

One muscle in particular’s growth caught my attention - the muscle grouping on the front side of my lower leg, near the outside of the leg (closer to the little toe). 

Is that normal? Or am I running funny and accidentally developing that? I also noticed when my muscle was tight after a poor stretch before a run. The difference isn’t aesthetically prominent but my leg shape is different upon close inspection.

4. modest lacerations on both palms.

I'm currently using a Garmin Fenix 5S, but have been looking to upgrade as a Christmas gift to myself this year. I wouldn't mind changing ecosystem if it's for the better, but it seems to me that there's no ""perfect"" watch. Suunto, Garmin, Coros, Polar, etc. all have their own strengths and weaknesses. 

Anyways, today the wife asked me ""Well, what's the Rolls Royce of running watches?"" and I couldn't really come up with an answer. So I'm curious to hear what you guys say?",What do you consider the Rolls Royce of running/outdoor watches?,Evil-economist,1608984454,2020-12-26 12:07:34
running,"Hi everyone, hope you all had a great Christmas! Currently I have the Polar Vantage M, I use it for tracking sports (skiing, tennis, padel,..) but mainly for running and tracking my sleep. I’m pretty happy with it but I’m doubting switching over to an Apple Watch SE cellular 40mm. These are my pros and cons of either device:

Polar PRO:

- I like the polar flow sync and integration for setting goals, in the diary it gives you a full training program with running (based on hearth rate zones), mobility and stretching exercises for your goal
- Lots of detailed data of my runs (cadence, heart rate zones, cardio load/ training impuls,...) and sleep (nightly recharge, autonomic nervous system charge, breathing rate, sleep charge/structure/solidity/regeneration/...)
- Polar app on iPhone, I find it relatively easy to see and interpret my data
- Battery life

POLAR CONS:

- Doesn’t have cellular, so I need to take my iPhone with me for Spotify etc (big one for me)
- Pretty heavy, I don’t mind it during the day or during my activities but it’s not pleasant at night. 5 out of 7 days I wake up without my watch on my wrist. I think I take it, not knowingly, off during my sleep.

APPLE WATCH PRO:

- I like the square design more
- Apples ecosystem
- Cellular, so from streaming Spotify to taking calls and answering texts. Which means that I can leave my iPhone at home or in my car more often. (Big pro for me)
- Weighs less and smaller = more comfortable

APPLE WATCH CONS:

- Far less detailed running data and sleep analyzing
- Battery life


What’s holding me against getting the Apple Watch is that the running data, as far as I know, isn’t as detailed as on the Polar and not having something like the full training program from Polar Flow which you can then link with your watch. I’m training for a marathon so the detailed data on my running/sleeping is pretty handy. I know Nike run club has something similar, but I don’t know if it’s any good... But on the other hand I hate taking my phone with me during runs for music or to make a quick call or something. Has anyone made the switch or is the running data/analysis on an Apple Watch good enough or are there apps that do it well/better? What are your thoughts?

Quick Q I was hoping you could maybe help me with. I live in SoCal, so it never gets too cold, but running November-March does get a bit chilly for me.

running,"So a little while ago, I posted asking about other methods besides the C25K. I have medical/surgical history/trauma that has led to me being weaker than a lot of others my age.

Anyway, after the advice, I decided to pretty much increase me walking and add in running. I ran until it stopped feeling good and took rest days when I was sore. This has now meant that I can run 1.5km in one go. I have a very loose goal of being able  to run 2.5-3km by the last week of January.

I’m pretty proud of my progress. I know it’s not the traditional way, but I am also working on becoming more in tune with my body on a whole and have started meditation.

The only issue I’m having is managing my calories in. I wouldn’t have thought the slight increase in activity would have that much of an impact on my calorie requirements but I’ve already lost 3kg. I don’t count calories, but I don’t eat fast food or high fat/sugar food as I can’t tolerate it. My stomach is smaller than other people my ages and isn’t able to accommodate what most people would class as a normal sized meal (it won’t stretch or get any bigger either) so I have to have multiple smaller meals through the day. Fortunately I have secured a job that allows multiple breaks during the day but that doesn’t start until end of January.

I run first thing in the morning as it wakes me up for the day. I can’t eat beforehand as it makes me nauseous and then the running itself tends to stop me being hungry. I’m thinking of adding some sort of drink about an hour after my ‘run’ just to keep my intake up.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for being so supportive. I’m enjoying the short time I am running, my body is feeling good and my mind is feeling good. I’m so thankful I’ve been able to do this again, it really is a great activity. The benefits I’m experiencing are very enjoyable even at this short distance. Once I was able to remind myself that it’s about the journey and not the destination I’ve been able to relax more and not be so hard on myself. I’m not going to win any medals, but just the fact that I’m feeling so much better is enough of a win for me.",I can now run 1.5km thanks to you,PizzaCutter,1608960859,2020-12-26 05:34:19

I ended up getting pretty into running last year, running my first half marathon last fall in the 1:35:00 range. I trained for 2-3 months using the Hal Higdon intermediate HM training, running like 5x a week, about 25-30 miles a week, then one day at the gym for weight lifting, then one rest day. I would also stop by the gym after my runs pretty frequently just to get a couple lifts in (ie 3-4 sets of bench press after a 5-6 mile run) 

I probably cut 4-5 pounds doing this with all the running and was pretty happy with the muscle definition I gained just from the loss in body fat. 

I want to try and train for a marathon next using Hal Higdons program, and I was wondering if any marathon runners who are also into weight lifting/aesthetics on what kind of routines they used to further add muscle definition. I'm assuming high rep lifts, or high amounts of body weight exercises would be best. Like X amount of pushups each day, X times per week, with pullups etc. along with high mileage running.

I've been running for 3 years now and I feel every year I make progress.

one of my objective at the beginning of the year was to run 1000k, which I completed late November.

my second objective was to run a 5k in 20 min so 4:00/km...

I seem to have plateaued since June and I know my sweet spot running temperature is 8-12 DegC (~45-50 F)

 instead of a snowy Christmas it was a rainy and warm 12 DegC so I decided to try for it one last time.

I was able to do my 2nd fastest 5k at 21:37min.

I have very thick and muscular legs and calfs and I could maybe loose 10-15lbs but probably not much more.

is it possible to run a 5k in 20:00 if you weight 210lbs?

I've been reading about strategies for the half marathon, and I've read that negative splitting might be a good idea (which is what I did for my last 1/2 marathon). If I were going to try to average an 8 min/mi, I think I'd try to run my first mile in 8:25, and gradually get faster. Maybe my first 10k would be around 51 minutes... Then for miles 7-10 I'd try to pick it up and run slightly below 8, and just keep a steady rhythm, and then really push for the last couple of miles. Does this sound like a good strategy, or is there something else that you'd recommend? I'm open to any suggestions! 

I know I should probably do some longer runs before attempting this, but I'm just anxious to see what I can do. The other day I went for an 8 mile run and I felt pretty good - miles were in 7:40s to 7:50s. 

From your experience, how should I be feeling during the half marathon in terms of discomfort? Roughly at which mile should it start to feel hard if I want to achieve my goal? Mile 10? If I'm hurting a bit halfway through, does that mean I started off too fast or am I doing it right? I don't want to be in pain from the beginning (hence the negative split), but I don't want to get to mile 12 feeling like I could run another 10k.

At first, I was disappointed for this year: I wanted to run a 10k. 2020 happened for all of us, and l, personally, had an extra-tumultuous fall. My 10k training fell apart in early October, and never really recovered. 

So, since I wasn’t ready for a 10k this year, I just decided to run the same route (and even took a picture in the [same place ](https://imgur.com/a/SVnqjnV)  as I did last year— I was 2 minutes faster today, even with a training program that absolutely fell apart 2 months ago!!! So, there was tiny progress after all! 

This year, I felt a little less insecure than I did last year.

I also got a running-related Christmas present: a really bright light that straps on (and has front and back lights!!). So, I guess I’m officially ‘one of the gang!’ I’m hoping to get a chance to try it out soon, my Christmas run definitely happened during daylight today!

1. Even more boring run - built a short circle route with no  beatiful views and try to run as much circles as you can to improve your long term psychological stability.
2. Snickers or any other bar - grab only one small Snickers and try to run 20+ km. Helps to control your energy consumption.
3. Climbing - grab your climbing shoes, your running backpack and a nice green apple. You know what to do.

My secret? I didn’t really run a lot :)

Let me explain. I play a lot of football (soccer) and I wanted to get my stamina better because I always get tired, so I started doing a lot of drills that required a lot of “energy” I should say. 

The more I did those drills and the more I played football gave me so much stamina and endurance that it actually made my 5km a lot easier and faster.

running,"I (28M) weighed 265lbs (120kg) back in March. Decided to change things around and started dieting. I didn't want to exercise at that point since I already had to deal mentally with not breaking my caloric deficit. I gave myself a weight goal before I was going to start doing any physical activity. When I hit that goal, which was exactly 8 months ago, I went for a run.    
   
I knew it was going to be hard after years of being fat, but it was downright embarassing. Ran 0.7km and had to sit down for a solid 10 minutes and fight for breath. But I didn't quit. I went back the next day... and the next... and the next...    
   
I had to face multiple problems. I got weirdly injured twice (both times had to take a 20 day break). First injury was the worst - a strained muscle in my pelvic area. Couldn't visit a doctor due to COVID. I don't know how I did it, but I just woke up with a very painful spot. The worst part was everytime I sneezed the pain would come back worse than before. It seemed like this muscle's only use is to contract while sneezing. Through trial and error I figured out how to twist my body when I felt like sneezing and managed to stop it from contracting. I went back to running when I fully healed and ran my first 10k shortly after.    
   
I kept pushing, 15km, then 18km and so I decided that it was time to run a half marathon. [So I did](https://i.ibb.co/bWQWmLh/IMG-20201225-003931.jpg).  

  

While I was proud of my achievement, two problems stuck out like a sore thumb. I was very slow and my heart rate was too high. This was a period when COVID cases were very low so I visited a cardiologist. My resting heart rate was 48. My blood pressure was great. I found this quite funny since the last time I saw the doctor was two years prior when I came in due to high BP with 300lbs . I asked him why my heart rate spiked to 100% when I tried to run anywhere near 6 min/km (9:40 min/mile). His answer was ""Yea, years of being obese and inactive tend to do that. Give it time and follow some kind of a running program for speed"". So I did.  

  

Easy runs, intervals, strength training, tempo, all that jazz (no hills, don't have any). Got sidelined for 20 days when I hurt my foot. Kept at it. Pushed through. My 10K PB is 4:48 min/km (7:43 min/mile). HR was getting better and I got much faster.  

  

But it had to be put to a test. What better date than exactly 8 months since I started running. Ending the year with a bang. I went out today. It was raining for an hour during my run, but it didn't bother me. I was going to do this no matter what. There were ups and downs, [but I managed to finish it in sub 2h](https://i.ibb.co/W6hkxx8/IMG-20201225-004020.jpg).  

  

Life is good today.  

  

Looking forward to 2021. If all goes well I plan to run my first marathon. After that a 50K ultra and in time a 100K as an ultimate victory over my previous way of life.

running,"I have been running for ~2 months now and I absolutely love it. It allows me to mentally push myself &amp; gives me purpose in my day. But lately, the trails I normally run on (empty w/ no one there) have been filling up with a lot more people. 

I absolutely cannot stop worrying if I’m going to get covid by running past someone for a few seconds in their closer than 6-foot presence.

running,"Hi all, so I have been running for a few years now, and am a little frustrated. I’ve noticed I have been inconsistent w my running routine and practice over the years and don’t really feel like I have made the progress I feel I should have made by now. Right now, I’ve noticed my motivation to run is circling around just doing it because I know logically it is healthy and keeps my body moving, especially during COVID, instead of for personal gain or because I know it makes it feel good. And then while I’m running the way I kinda get through it is playing music that I know really gets me going and allows me to zone out of the actual action of running. Generally if I don’t listen to music or music fast paced enough, I get bored.

I think in these two things lies my problem, but I’m not sure how to fix them. I am thinking of trying a more mindful running routine that doesn’t involve music and just focuses on how it makes me feel and the process and allows the mental and physical benefits to shine through, but I know it’s easier said than done.

running,"I often find that during my recovery period mid-run, I start to think more rationally and logically pertaining to my thoughts/feelings/emotions within reason (it's okay to feel). One could argue that intellectualizing emotions isn't healthy in the long-run (pardon the pun!), but it seems like my mental clarity regarding introspection, self-reflection, positive affirmations, individuality, interpersonal relationships, difficult conversations, and the collective community (self vs. others within society) as a whole increase tenfold in the midst of rest before I resume my run again (re-wiring the brain). My outlook towards life, in general, improves in leaps and bounds within such a short time frame.

Regrets, fears, guilt, shame, pain, suffering, self-doubt, etc. all feel like insignificant problems in the short to medium term yet able to be confronted as time heals. Running has become a form of escapism for me, but without the grave emotional consequences that would result from a drug i.e. alcohol/weed, or failure to face the man in the mirror and kill my pride as well as silence my ego in the process. It's also a type of meditative therapy for me as I go through the motions with an attitude of gratitude and deep breathing. A sense of spirituality here.

I'm eternally thankful that I have running as an outlet for anxious/depressive moods too. No bad energy or negative thought patterns upon completion (self-talk). Running is also a way I practice being purposeful and diligent. I hope I managed to articulate this feeling properly. In essence, this is why I run.

running,"Hi, I've been running about 40 years - til a freak slip &amp; fall and head injury that resulted in some internal bleeding earlier in the year.  For about 9 months I had to stop, but fortunately the condition appears to be nearly resolved, and my Dr advises I can resume running, slowly, as long as I minimize any 'hard impact'  repetitive pounding - to avoid aggravating the condition again.  I'm a pretty neutral pronation flat-foot striker... generally on treadmill only in winter... and mostly asphalt in warmer months.  I don't run for speed, just duration, for general weight maintenance and cardio strength. Shoes I've worn in the past have been the old NB 882/883, 840...and Brooks Ghost.

So anyway, my local running store suggested the Hoka One Bondi 7 and Saucony Triumph 17 or 18 as best fitting my needs...and they have a wide width which i need (10 -2E).   

Anyone ever specifically compare these two?  I know there's alot of mention of the Bondi being a rather heavy shoe.

running,"Hi fellow Reddit Runners! 

I ran a lot in my late teens, stopped for around 5 years but since the first lockdown around March it's been coming back to me. The last 3 months have been much more consistent and finally starting to find my stride. Averaging around 35km a week so nothing crazy, but would like to now work out a more focused training plan to take things a bit further.

I normally slog away at around 5:20/km for most runs, whether they are 5km or 15km. To be honest it's been more about keeping my head in check and just happy to get back out on the roads.

For some PB benchmarks..
5KM - 24:02
10KM - 52:22
21KM - 1:56:30

I have this written down as a training plan I hope to take in January, any guidance on order of runs or any changes you would make, runs to take away or add etc are very welcome. Would love to hear your thoughts..

Long Run
6:00 pace - 13km, 15km, 18km, 21km

Tempo Run
5:15 pace 7km, 8km, 9km, 10km

Recovery Run

Intervals
1.5km warm up, 5x400m hard push, 1.5km warm down

running,"I’m new to running in general. I started in late May/early June and have been consistent with it. But obviously I started outside when it was warmer. However since last month, with a few exceptions, I’ve been going to the local Rec center and using their treadmills because of weather/cold (yes I know you can run in the cold, but I’m a freeze baby and even with layers I just don’t have a good time).

There were some things I noticed within the first week of using treadmills (also my first time with running equipment): a). It was so much less stressful than running outside! Sounds pretty self explanatory but I hadn’t given thought to just how much mental energy I was using watching out for potholes, upward tilting sidewalks, poor drivers, bicyclists, etc. B). Probably r/t point a)., but I found it so much easier to get “in the zone” on a tread. I mean, within minutes of focusing on my breath and staring straight ahead, it’s as though I’m transfixed and in a state of unawareness, bit conscious enough to know of my surroundings. C). Obviously, won’t have to deal with snow/high winds if you are like me and get pummeled by winter weather. D). You can control the speed and see how fast you’re running in real time.

Some of the cons: a). lack of change of scenery, can get dull if not in a good headspace. B). Dirty gym equipment, c). To me, the act of running on a treadmill feels almost unnatural and it definitely feels different (to me) than running. D). The urge to keep looking at your pace/mileage/time is too real and can keep you out of the moment (I’ve started to just cover those metrics up). E). I miss hearing nature when running.

One other possible pro: I have gone outside to run one time in December since using the treadmill, and I swore I was running so slow and it felt much different than the tread. However when I had finished running 7 miles, I ran in just under an hour and at a significantly faster pace than the month prior when my pace was stagnant.

6 days ago, I had my reality check that I wasn’t very happy or healthy when I randomly did a bleep test (20m) with my husband and got 4.5. I was shocked and embarrassed. 

I immediately started running and I changed my diet drastically. 

I did a 5k (in around 40 minutes) for 4 days in a row then unsurprisingly developed some pretty bad hip pain. I realised I’d obviously got a little carried away and needed to reign it in and work on stretching out my coach potato muscles. 

I had a rest day yesterday to recover from my hip pain and then did another bleep test today.

I got 6.0 and I am so so proud!

Just a few days after overhauling my lifestyle, I’ve managed to improve so much. I don’t even care if the improvement was from the changes I’ve made mentally, as opposed to a sudden change in fitness. 

I’m now doing daily stretching sessions to work on my tight muscles, a light 2k jog 4 times a week and other bits of strength training on the other days. I will up the length of my runs once I feel my body is comfortably doing 2k with no issues.

running,"I went out the other day for 5 miles at a much faster pace then I am used to and ended up hitting a PR for my 5k. When I finished, I figured my calves were going to be screaming the next morning but surprisingly I was ok. 

This got me thinking about why they weren’t hurting as much as I thought and I attributed it to my form on my run the day before. To achieve the faster pace I was running, my form also had to change. My stride opened up, I stayed up on my toes more and prevented my heel from striking, my cadence increased, and my foot contact time with the ground was greatly diminished. Clearly this all makes sense as to why I wasn’t as sore as I had thought. Lighter feet = less impact = less soreness.  

Now here’s the kicker... my lungs clearly can’t sustain that pace for longer runs. So now I’m facing a trade-off of do I want my calves, ankles, and knees to be sore by slowing down and running further? Or do I want to continue running shorter distances faster and probably more often?

running,"Ok I’m embarrassed to say that as a physical therapist and someone with a background in exercise science, I cannot effectively argue with my wife about how her theoretical training plan won’t work.

My wife is asking why you can’t train (or why people don’t train) to run long distances by purely sprint training.  

Example: pick what pace you want to run a 5k at (example 4 minute pace).  Day 1 of training you try to run at the 4 min pace as far as you can.  Day 2 you try to run a little farther at the 4 min pace.  Each day you would do that until you are able to do it for an entire 5k.

Obviously this is a bad way of training, but why?  I understand that if 4 minute pace is all out for you, then you are working your anaerobic energy system and never working the aerobic system.  I’m guessing her method would work if it was put into intervals and you did it repeatedly during a session and turned into HIIT training.

running,"Hi all, first-time runner here. I have been an avid walker for years, and would typically challenge myself with hills/hiking and speedwalking, but have always been afraid of running. After doing more research I recently decided to try transitioning to running, and I've been loving it. The key has been to run reaaaaally slowly. Since late November, I've gone from celebrating running my first mile without stopping (and feeling really sore the next day) to running a couple of miles and feeling like I could go on for more but stopping because I don't want to do too much too soon. 

I'm undecided what my next goal should be. The options I'm considering are 1) run a couple of miles every day/every other day, combined with walking/hiking, 2) try HIIT and run 3-4 times a week, 3) try increasing my speed overall 3-4 times a week, and 4) try increasing my distance overall 3-4 times a week. I do feel like I'm still trying to figure out what a comfortable gait and form are for me. 

One of the things I love about running is that you can get into the same meditative zone as you can while walking. Today I felt like I had just entered that meditative zone when I realized that I had only half a mile to go before hitting my two-mile goal. I felt so disappointed.

Anyway. This is sort of an invitation for folks to weigh in on how I can/should push myself and mostly a celebration of running being awesome. 

For context: I'm 34/F, 5'4"" and currently weigh 150. Goals are weight loss, general fitness, and maintaining my mental health. Because of the latter, I lean a bit toward running shorter and more manageable distances more frequently (thus option number 1 above).

running,"Hi, my name is flamingcrepes and my last run was October 3. I thought I was handling the pandemic well, and it turns out it was mostly (probably only) because of running. Here comes my pity party...

Backstory: I’ve had knee issues for almost 10 years. I finally decided to go to an orthopedist this year (before pandemic times, therefore I ended up dealing with drs offices during, yay). Pain would show up the day after exercise, and be pretty awful, stairs were a nightmare. MRI in February. 

Cartilage was gone. In both knees. Cortisone didn’t touch the pain. Nothing. I was told it was a miracle cure, but whatever. Orthovisc was administered in mid/late June. By the first week of September, the pain was back, worse and starting during runs. Doc sent me to a different doc because he can’t do a MACI procedure (cloning some of my cartilage, growing it and cookie cuttering it into place). Wait a month for new doc, and he says, “I only do replacements, you don’t need that.” Awesome, I waited a month for that?!?? 

Miraculously, new new doc had an appointment on Friday (this was Monday) and I got some more PT prescribed. Month later, surgery is planned. On the 28th, I go under. It might be an arthroscopy to gather a shred of cartilage to clone, it might be a realignment of the patella. All depends on the cartilage situation or lack thereof. 

I’m a mess. I miss running soooo much. It is a lifeline. Life is literally darker. Even walking causes pain. Running gives me a sense of power, gives me so much energy, it’s life. 

All this to say, please wish me luck? May I be back among your ranks soon. Run on, and do a quarter mile for me!!",I. Miss. Running.,flamingcrepes,1608769138,2020-12-24 00:18:58

running,"So, never been a big runner. More of a hiker. Never had problems with the latter (can do a ten mile hike up and down a mountain at a pretty quick pace, no problem), but the former is an issue. 

I started running a few times a week at the start of the pandemic. Nothing too strenuous, maybe a couple miles at a time.  The whole time I’ve had intermittent leg pain while running, and during recovery, to the point where my legs feel like jello and I’m afraid my legs will give out and I’ll wipe out on the sidewalk.  

Yes, it’s as pathetic as that sounds and my own friends and family make fun of me for it, just telling me I’m being dramatic and to push through the pain. 

For example today, I went out for a quick mid-day run (intending to go a couple miles) and within two city blocks the pain in my legs was unbearable, particularly my shins. Just throbbing waves of pain and fatigue, accompanied by what felt like leg tremors. I had to walk the rest of the way.  Last I ran without much issue was 1.5 miles two days ago (plenty of recovery time, right?).

So what’s wrong here?  I’m in my early 40’s, not overweight, eat healthy, am generally in good cardiovascular health, and do have some muscle on my legs from years of hiking.

Quick disclaimer, I am mainly a soccer player and run to help myself on the pitch.

My current VO2 max is 50, over the last 2 weeks or so I have significantly increased my work load.

I do AMRAP trainings, I cycle (XC Mountainbiking) &amp; do atleast 2 interval runs a week. My interval trainings look as follows: 30s sprint followed by 30s rest and I repeat this 8 times, rest for 5 min and repeat 8 more times.

 I used to purely be a mountainbiker, during this period my VO2 max was roughly 55, keep in mind all the numbers im throwing around here where calculated my by Garmin Forerunner 45 so they are definetly not 100% acccurate but I believe they give a good indication. 

Eventhough I feel like my athletic ability has already increased in such a short period of time simply due to good sleep, workouts &amp; diet I have seen no changes in my VO2 max.

running,"I’m a fairly new runner (started in August) but have already dealt with tendinitis in my Achilles (fixed with week rest) and then shortly after got posterior tibial tendonitis in the same foot. I overlooked the injury for about a month because it never got worse. Eventually, after my Sunday long runs, it would get worse and worse every week. After about 2 months, I finally decided to take a week off. This helped in that the pain went away from walking but this Sunday I decided to run on it again. It felt the exact same and I lost all hope because I had been doing everything I could (ice baths, resting, stretching) and I figured since it didn’t hurt to walk anymore I would finally be pain free running. 

I looked up other ways to overcome this injury, and completely overlooked foam rolling. In just 3 days of rolling the shit out of my calves which had a couple knots, it has practically disappeared.

running,"I'm a 5""7' male (22) and weigh about 180lbs. I work out a lot though and am in the military, so I'm not overweight just short and stocky. My current 5K pace if I push it is around 22:30 on a good day. Typical workout pace is around 8:30 for 4 - 6 miles.

The problem I'm running into is that I have this cycle where I'll be running for a week or two consistently, and then something hurts and I need to take a break for about a week before I start up again. It used to be plantar fasciitis (which is now mostly fixed), earlier it was upper calf pain, this week it was shin splints. I know how to deal with these things thankfully, I do all the stretches and warmups and rolling, but I hate that they keep cropping up right as I start to get the flow of things. This pattern has been consistent for several months now.

My friend who is a workout specialist (forget the exact name) suggested that the issue might be my lack of cross training for lateral movement. If I go to the gym, I'll either run, sprint, or do upper body workouts. I don't do lower body usually, which also means I don't do side to side jumps or anything that might build supporting foot and calf muscles. I've started doing calf raises which have helped.

running,"Hello,

I'm a 35yo male, and started running about 2 months and a half ago. I was fairly out of shape so the C25k program was perfect. I graduated in week 8 and since then have been running three times a week. Twice under the week, i run 5k and on Sundays, I'm gradually increasing 500m at a time (ran 6km last Sunday) and intended to get to 10k in about 2 months.

Overall I'm pretty happy with how I've been doing but I'm starting to feel a bit nervous about what comes next. I have this pattern that I love to see and feel myself progressing but tend to get bored and disengage when progress inevitably gets too slow to really notice.
I'm still progressing, but as I hit a new PR (25'55 for 5k), I realized that I kind of expect to beat my PR every time.

I'm pretty confident that I'm going to reach my goal of running my first 10k in a couple of months. I will likely be able to improve my pace below 5'00 pretty km fairly soon too, but I'm going to hit a wall where I'm going to have to be more patient and put on the long slow work to hit more milestones, and I'm a bit anxious I'm not gonna keep at it although I enjoy running much more than anticipated.

Do you have any advice or word of wisdom to help me handle this? I don't have a clear long term goal but I'd really like to keep running for a long time, especially as I'm a nerd, working from home, all day long in front of a computer screen, and struggling with depression.

After 180 km and 30 runs I decided to buy a proper pair of running shoes. My previous sneakers were Adidas NMD's (casual wear, with a flat sole). I went and bought Kiprun kd plus shoes from Decathlon and had my first run with them this morning.  
It felt odd and I felt like my ankles were rolling inwards with every strike, to counter that I changed the angle of my foot but it just put on some strain on my chin muscles.  
Am just wondering if I need to change the way I run, if I indeed need flat soled shoes to run or if this will correct itself with time as I break the shoe in.

running,"I am 28F, 5ft 3, 53kg (and very slowly rising) and a BMI of 21. 

I decided to overhaul my lifestyle 4 days ago after I tried the bleep test with my husband and got 4.5, which is poor and embarrassing. 

I reduced my daily calorie intake (from maybe 2,400) and am doing intense exercise 6 days per week to hopefully drop a couple of kilos and live a healthier lifestyle. 

3 days ago, I did a 2.5k trail run. Yesterday and today, I did a 5k road run in around 40 minutes then 45 minutes. 

I feel pleasantly surprised with my cardio abilities and muscle stamina, but I’m having one major issue with my hips.

I had a very mild ache in my right hip (all the way from the inside where my groin meets my hip, around the front to the outside of my hip) on my trail run 3 days ago. On my 5k yesterday, my right hip was sore after 1k. I had to stop and do some dynamic stretches around 3k in, as it was very sore. I think the stretches helped me to complete the run. 

Most of my muscles from my waist down were achy when I went out today (despite lots of stretching after my run yesterday), but a couple of minutes in my left hip this time was very sore. It felt the sorest when I brought it in front of my body. About 3.5k in, I had to stop and walk/hobble home. I felt completely stiff and very achy. It’s still sore to move now, but much much less painful. 

I recall having this pain before while on walks a few times, but not in a long while. 

I’ve been doing 20 minutes of stretching per day, plus before and after, as my husband thinks my hip flexers could be tight, as I’m pretty inflexible. 

I wear proper Salomon running shoes. I also have very high arches. 

I’m going to continue daily stretching sessions in the hope it fixes the issue, but what if it’s not this? Could it just be because I’m not used to running? What do I do in the meantime if I can’t run without pain? Is this causing me damage? 

Any thoughts please? Please ask any questions! Thanks.","I am very new to running, but hip pain is really really holding me back. What’s causing this?",TTC1992,1608675954,2020-12-22 22:25:54

But I need some help to get enough. What are some good goals that aren't necessarily based on progress? So far my list looks like this:

1. run in the rain
2. run in the snow
3. 2 runs in a day
4. catch the sunrise
5. catch the sunset
6. run in a costume
7. set a distance PR

12. duathlon
13. run home (get dropped off, run back)
14. run ""without"" watch (tbh, probably just tucked away)
15. silent run
16. trail run

Goals should heavily favor single-day accomplishments suitable for any runner. The running streak and PRs are the outliers here, and probably my limit for mid-term goals.

running,"TL;DR: I want to run a 5+21km in September 2021. My currently mileage is low, signed up for a 5km in April as a halfway gauge. Looking for tips/feasibility.

=-=-=

I live in Canada, and I’ve always wanted to compete (complete) the Army run that we have here every September for mental health awareness for veterans. 

I know I could complete a 5km, I’ve done it in training before with horrible training leading up to it, but it was done. I’ve recently wanted to get into running and have slowly been adding mileage. 

The race I want to complete is called the Commanders Challenge and it requires running the 5km at a decent pace and then running the Half Marathon right after (hence the 5+21km). I say decent pace because you have to finish the 5km before the launch of the last wave of the 21km run. (Note: technically I can walk/run the 21km but I want to run it as a matter of pride)

I’ve signed up for a 5km in April since I thought logically that it’s roughly the halfway point and if I can do decent time there that I can tailor training for the half marathon part a few months later.

I’ve run nowhere near a half marathon before, so I’m asking if anyone has experience in this kind of dual phase training or what I should focus on?

I’m using a Garmin and threw on a coaching program for the 5km so I am running 3x a week of varying distance/training leading up to it.

Main questions:
- should I schedule the 5km for like February then schedule a 10km for like May instead?
- how does one go from largely 0 to 5km to 26km in 9 months? 
- is it crazy to even think this is possible?

running,"Hello runnit, I've recently been thinking about getting into trail running.  In the past, I've had trouble dealing with wildlife safely.  An example of this is there was a two week period where I was in not one, not two, but THREE squirrel attacks.  I am not sure why they attacked, but they did, so I am clearly a target for squirrels. 

My question is, how do I deal with wildlife such as this? I typically would run with a bag of assorted nuts as my fuel during the run, (a sort of natural GU if you will). I would like to keep this up.  What type of protection should I use against these pests? I've thought about bringing a .22 but I'm not sure if it's worth the bulk or even if it's enough firepower.

running,"I started running two-ish months ago. I was a complete couch potato, haven't even been walking much this year due to covid. Depression was sneaking in because of everything that has happened this year, it has been so much more than just covid for me. Figured I should start exercising because it is a known fact that it helps with your mood. Running felt like the obvious option because it's easy to start and cheap. I had done exercise in my life, but always absolutely hated running. So I made sure to start slow. At my first jog I told myself it is ok to mostly walk as long as I run a little bit. Still felt like death. I was horrified at my terrible condition. At first the runs were more walking than running.

Last night I ran 7.9 kilometres (a little less than 5 miles for all my Americans in here). It was my longest run so far. I know it is not much compared to actual runners, but I myself can't believe it! I am immensely proud of myself. Me, who always hated running and getting out of breath in general. I can do that?! I used to get out of breath when walking! Now no amount of walking will make me even break a sweat. My body can suddenly do so much. I feel so strong and so healthy! In all my 26 years on this earth I have never been in such good condition. I have less aches and pains in general, am less bloated, don't get cold as easy, my heart rate has lowered (I have been monitoring it due to medication) and I am even stretchier although I haven't been stretching much at all. I have never before been able to reach my toes while legs straight! Even my self esteem is better, I feel more capable and love what I see in the mirror although I couldn't have visually changed much at all. And what's more, I am one of the lucky few who get intense runner's highs quite easily! No wonder I am HOOKED.

I feel very accomplished to have stuck to running this long. Even though it's factually not that long, it's long for me. I tend to start hobbies with great enthusiasm and stop pretty darn fast. I can't stop talking about running. I am boring everyone around me, but I'm just so happy and excited. This hobby has helped me immensely with very tough times I've been having. My only regret is I didn't start sooner. Who would've though I'd fall in love with running of all things.

I live in a safe, low crime town/neighborhood, but I understand that they’re concerned since I’m a young girl and we don’t know some of my neighbors too well. I have a treadmill, but it’s older than me and the incline/fan doesn’t work so it really sucks trying to run more than 10 minutes on it without wanting to quit. My dad has also occasionally biked behind me while I ran, but with it being winter now he refuses; even before that, I’d have to wait until he’d get home from work and hope he wasn’t too tired. Basically, I just want to be able to run outside without arguing with my parents for 20 minutes beforehand only to go on the treadmill and give up 10 minutes later.

I'd like to know how you experience your body's energy when running somewhat longer distances without using gels and the likes. Thus you run as far as you can go comfortably without additional energy.

For me, the first few minutes are always super difficult, my muscles might cramp up and I feel like I have very little energy. Then it gets easier. Temporarily. I basically get what feels like little parcels of energy, my pulse goes down, running is easy. This lasts for about 3-4 minutes and then running becomes more difficult again, and pulse goes up for roughly 6-7 minutes until my body finds another little parcel of energy somewhere, rinse and repeat.

### Training
I'm a pretty new runner. I started running last year in October, with the hope to run a half marathon this year. My training went pretty good but I got some injury that kept me from running for some months. Basically I didnt run from May until November. 
I started building it up again,very slowly. Running 3 times a week. Starting with 2k and now doing around 4k per run. Usual pace is around 7:00/k. Ive been running together with my fiancée. She usually plays volleyball but with the pandemic that is cancelled, so she joins me to keep her fitness up. And its fun to run together.

### Pre-race
I was pretty nervous. My previous run I was way too hot (was about 10c and I was wearing leggings, long sleeve shirt and another shirt on top), so decided to just wear shirts and a long sleeve shirt. Rather be cold than hot. 

The race is a pretty big thing locally, but because of Corona they made virtual races with Strava segments (more on that later). 

We arrived and parked near the start finishline. We had seen on facebook that they had put a big banner on the road as official start/finish point, but we couldnt find it. Called someone and walked around a bit, but no luck. Meanwhile I started getting cold, of course.
 
### Race
We decided to just go for it, and went off. A lot of runners had started in front of us, which was nice. I had planned on putting some guide paces on my Garmin, but forgot. So we just decided to run at easy pace for a bit. 
Being nervous, my fiancée told me to slow down (good call). Settled in at 7:00/k pace for the first km.

Feeling good (change of scenery is great) we naturally started going a bit faster (6:30). The weather was great, cold and hardly any wind. I still felt fine with the pace even if I was worried about not finishing. 
At 2.5 k the 7k loop and our 5k loop merged and if luck would have it, we came accross my fiancée's brother. He was doing all the loops (15+7+5) and is a great runner. We yelled some encouraging words, he returned them and after a few seconds he recognized us.
We ran together, but told him to go ahead (because his pace usually is 4:30/5:00 or something like that) but he said he was happy to run together. 
He did go a bit faster that I wanted but it resulted in a pretty fast (for me) 6:30 third k. 
Between 3 and 4 I started to feel more tired and felt the pace was a bit too fast for me. I still tried to hang on, but her brother ran ahead of us (about 20m) and my fiancée about 10m. She dropped back to me and we ran together. At around 4.5k she asked if she could catch up to him and race him. 
Didnt want to pull her back and feeling that I couldn't go much faster, I told her to go for it. 

She caught up and they sped off. This was pretty hard mentally but did try not to let my pace fall too much and finish. 

At the finish I stopped my garmin and it only said 4.91km. (either the segment was wrong or garmin is) so after a little bit I told them I'm doing another block so I get 5k. They joined me so we all had 5k.

### Post-race
We took some selfies and then went to my fiancée's parents to have a socially distant coffee. 

Pretty happy with how it went, overall.

running,"I've been running for around a month now. So far I have been loving it. The longest I've run is 2 miles but I usually average 1.5 miles per run. I do run at a pretty slow pace, 3.5-4 mph. However, I recently read that running can be hard on your knees and obese people should avoid running. 

Some more background:

During the summer and fall I hiked a lot, usually around 20 miles a week, with one longer 5 mile hike a week. I stopped because it gets dark really early so I don't have time to go out after work. I still go occasionally on the weekends.

I used to lift weights so my legs are strong and quite muscular.

So I decided, let’s see if we can beat the old PR of 7 miles and go for 8. By the time 8 rolled around, I figured “heck, let’s just make this a 15k. We’re almost there.” Then as I was closing in on the 15k, I wasn’t tired so figured an even 10 miles would be a good place to call it a day. I couldn’t believe it.

running,"Sorry for the long post. I (26F) started having bad acne I believe from the Merina birth control. I mentioned it to my gynecologist and she immediately prescribed me to 100mg a day of Spironolactone in January 2020. I assumed if she was able to prescribe it to me so easily without asking much about my health that it wasn’t necessary to consult my family doctor about it? Assumed it wasn’t a super serious medication, my roommate mentioned taking it and felt fine with it. After some time, I started experiencing chest pain, numbness, and tingling during my runs (I run about everyday). It got so bad I was pretty scared and wasn’t sure if it was from the meds or something else so I stopped taking the meds. 

Continued to have mild chest pains every now and then but felt alright enough to not mention it to a doctor (with corona virus starting this year I didn’t want to deal with going to the doctor unless absolutely necessary). Still struggled with acne and in November a skin doctor also recommended the medication. I mentioned my previous experience with it but I wasn’t positive if it was the cause of my issues. The doc said it’s possible I had too much potassium but she thought it was worth a shot to try again but with a lower dose, she prescribed me 50mg a day but since I was still nervous I only took 25mg. But have now been having chest pain/tightness again so I can only assume it’s from this medication so I stopped taking it a week ago. Just seems odd since I’ve been taking such a low dose...

The mild chest pains have happened a little since but today, after my long run, it got bad enough and also made me light headed that I am concerned, as my chest still feels somewhat tight tonight. I am wondering if it just takes a little bit for my body to return to normal or if I should go see a doctor tomorrow to check my potassium levels.. (only even worried about my potassium levels because of what I’ve read online as both of my doctors either didn’t mention it or acted as if it would not be a problem.)

running,"I consider myself to be in fairly good shape.  I am still pretty new to running, and I know there are a lot of people that are in much better cardiovascular shape than me, but I feel like I'm in pretty decent shape.  I completed 2 half marathons in 2019 with nearly identical times (1:58:47 and 1:58:51).  When I trained for those races, I didn't know about the benefits of zone 2 and was running way too fast (heart rate typically in the 170s), so I've tried slowing down a lot this year.  I have read about the benefits of zone 2, and I have really tried to stick with it in my training this year, but I am finding it incredibly frustrating! I have run over 500 miles this year, and I have tried to do the majority of those runs in zone 2.  I am beginning to think I need to re-evaluate what my true zone 2 range is.  I know for a fact my max heart rate is way higher than what is typical for my age (42).  In my half marathons, I maxed out at 187 and 188.  According to the 220 - your age formula, my max is 178.  I AVERAGED 175 in my second half marathon, and was 180 or higher for almost the entire last mile!  In my races, I averaged a 9:04/mile pace.  In my current zone 2 training, I have to slow down to around 13:20 - 13:45/mile for 4-5 mile runs.  I end up walking a ton! It seems even worse since I got my Garmin Forerunner 945 watch (previous watch was an Apple Watch series 3).  I think my Garmin registers a higher heart rate than my Apple Watch did.  My resting rate is about 63.  For my zone calculations in my Garmin, I set my max heart rate at 188 (the max from my last half marathon), and I chose the % of heart rate reserve calculation option.  This sets my zone 2 at 138 - 151.  I try to run as slow as I can, and I usually can't go more than a little over a half mile before I have to walk to get back into zone 2.  From there, I continue to try and run as slow as possible, but I have to start walking even more frequently to stay in zone 2.  Using the Maffetone method, I shouldn't go over 138.  This would be impossible! I would probably exceed that by power walking! I know it's supposed to be easy, but this seems way too easy! Is my true max heart rate higher than 188?

running,"Bounding technique to get faster for middle distances

I’m a 52 y.o. male who played soccer in college and briefly ran x-county before getting a 30 year knee injury... Anyway, I am currently in a base building phase, having upped my weekly mileage from 20 to 30 miles a week of easy running (about 10:30 mile pace), so about 6 hours of running a week . About a year ago, I broke 25 minutes for 5k and 7 minutes for the mile. ( on my own, not race times). In college, at age 19 and 55 lbs lighter, I broke 28 minutes for 8k x-country, and 4:13 for the mile..My goal, once COVID gets under control, is to either compete in 5k if I can get my time down or just fly past old dudes on the soccer pitch..

In addition to easy running 6 days a week, I am doing 6 to 8, 20 second strides 4 to 5 times a week at the end of the run, as I enjoy it, and to keep my leg speed. I have been researching running drills and plyometrics, and think that bounding might have the biggest payoff in terms of helping build top end speed/ strength/ elasticity, besides short maximal sprints. I’m going to stay away from other forms of plyometrics as it seems too risky for a 50 year old and I have read a study or 2 stating that short sprints with plenty of rest are more effective than plyometrics for running speed, and even jumping., 

The problem is I am not sure what type of bounding I should be doing i.e. running bounding, bounding up hills, straight leg bounding , bounding for distance or height , etc .. ?  Also, if I assume ‘ running bounding’ or alternate leg bounding  is the best for middle distance runners, what are common mistakes that people make or what key points should they focus on ? I haven’t found much on internet, besides videos of people bounding. It might be like trying to explain to a person how to walk, but before I invest some time into it, I want to make sure I am doing it right. If you have a better recommendation of a better drill to do, instead of bounding and short sprints, I’m all ears .

running,"**HELLO/INTRO**

Without going into detail, 2020 has been kicking my ass like I did it dirty; so I decided to pick up running. The only problem is, I hate running. Years ago, my doctor diagnosed me with “crunchy knees.” His treatment was simple, “If you can run 3 miles a day, you won’t have crunchy knees.” The problem was just as simple, I can’t run due to my crunchy knees. “Oh well,” I thought. “I’ll just be one of those ‘peaked in high school’ guys.”

I let myself go.

Until this year.

6 months ago I thought, “Y’know... I’ve got 3 young boys who need their dad to *not* be a 300lbs. couch potato. They need their dad to run, jump, camp, swim, catch/throw, and play with them.” That led me to my follow-up thought, “You know what needs to be done. Let’s do this.”

Today, I cover 25 miles a week
 - Warm-up walk (1 mile, to the footpath I like)
 - Run (just slightly more than a 5k @ 155bpm)
 - Cool-down walk (1 mile, home)
 
 
 
**FUN FACT**

Today is Winter Solstice. If you ran this morning, that was the darkest it’s gonna get. We’re halfway through the darkest hours of winter, and, from now on, your runs will start getting lighter, earlier. Until springtime and summertime, stay safe in the dark.

running,"Hi all

I've been running fairly regularly for over 10 years now, although despite that I've barely made any progress and have plateaued at a 27 min 5k, and a 55 min 10k.   My aim is to finally break through the 25min 5k barrier, and improve my running fitness as it's barely improved over 10 years of regular running which is quite depressing.  My stats are 33 years old, male, 5' 7"", 71kg if that helps.

I think one of the reasons is that I simply don't push myself hard enough, and that's because I seem to have an unusually high heart rate when running.  I appreciate that the ""magic formula"" of 220-age isn't an exact science (I'm 33, so my max bpm should in theory be 187) but that figure seems very low for me, for reasons you will see below.

My resting heart rate is around 60bpm, but when I run, even at a jog, it can quickly go to 160-170...yet I don't feel out of breath and can easily have a conversation.  Even at 180 I can chat and just about feel like I'm exerting myself.  The problem is, because my max should be 187, I feel like anything higher might be dangerous to sustain (and I do start to fatigue between 194-200, which I can hit if I'm running faster than 11km/h, which I know is not very fast!)

Because of this, I tried ""heart rate training"" where I deliberately run slower to keep my heart rate down and do longer distances (I'd aim for 7-10k), but after a few months of this I barely saw any progress.  I'd have to run at 7km/h in order to keep my heart rate low enough and wasn't even breaking a sweat.

So my question is: should I try to get comfortable sustaining high heart rates when running in order to get faster, or should I try to keep it within the recommended ranges and just aim for longer distances instead to build up my base at a lower heart rate?  

Also, I've had my heart checked a few times in the past (unrelated to running, but was offered a free heart screen and they said it's perfectly healthy).",Heart rate training for higher heart rates,lee_the_man,1608572541,2020-12-21 17:42:21

I followed this full body stretching routine video on YouTube, after a little light stretching on my own, which is almost 20min long and then I went out for running (5k currently). I came back and for cool down I did some recovery yoga (about 30mins) and then some body weight exercises. The problem with the pre run stretching video though, is that it mainly consists of static movements, not many dynamic ones.

But this was working fine for me (although I did feel a little sore sometimes) but now my schedule has changed a little and that's why I am not getting enough time to do all this. All of this sums up to about a couple of hours in the morning and I can't really afford that rn but I also don't want to quit running. 

So I came across this one video which was about warming up for a run in 7mins and then cool down in 5 (both by the Run Experience channel on YouTube). I watched the entire video and I thought it was actually sufficient to get me going. That and also the fact that most of these running channels advise you to warm up properly, not necessarily stretch before the run. 

Long story short, I followed both of those videos today and found the result to be okay-ish. I feel no soreness and the starting of my jog was quite pleasant today. So I just wanted to know about:
1. The long term effects, if any, of this routine that I followed today.
2. What routine do you guys follow.
3. Is it healthy to just stretch while warming up and then going out for a run?
4. Is this routine sufficient to keep me healthy in the long run?

The video I followed today for warmup includes knee hugs, jumping jacks, leg swings, high knees, calf pedals, inchworms and butt kicks. The cooldown video includes  squat hold, downward dog, upward dog, pigeon stretch, child's pose. Is this enough?

I am relatively new to running and I have no one to discuss all of this with, so that's why the long post. Any help will be very much appreciated :)",Is stretching before running necessary?,dhruv1311,1608539339,2020-12-21 08:28:59

running,"Fairly new to running. Started during the pandemic and gave a goal of running a half marathon. Currently run 3-4 miles a day several times a week with occasional longer runs of 6-8 miles.

I have these weird mental block where I am kind of OCD about keeping track of my runs/times/progress. I HAVE to run in mile increments. I can’t run 4.5 or 5.6. 

Also I have NEVER run, stopped briefly to walk, then started running again. I count my runs as how far I can run without stopping. I don’t know why it’s like a weird mental thing for me where if I run 6 miles, stop and walk, then run 4 more I don’t feel like I ran 10 miles. I feel like I ran 6 and 4. I know that it would probably help my training to mix in some breaks and allow myself to change up routines or push for more miles in a day.

running,"Obligatory ""English is my second language"".

So I am a guy that have gotten myself into quite a pickle: I have made a bet with a friend to compete in a 10k race that takes place in the end of april, and to be sure to beat him I need to be able to run my 10k around, or hopefully sub, 37 mins. 

So my question to you is whether this is possible, and how can I best do this (without getting injured)? I have been running all my life and used to practice triathlon (ran about 15-20k per week then) when I was 18-19 (23 now), so I'm not starting at square 1, but it's been a while since I was serious about running. I have tried getting started again a couple of times in the last years but have never really been able to keep it up, so now I usually just average one run of about 6k (4 miles) per week. The times I have tried getting serious I have found that my baseline, which I can achieve without basically any training even after a long break, is to run a 5k around 20 mins. From this I feel like a 10k sub 37 theoretically should be possible in these 4 months, but I need advice about how to structure my training and how to avoid injuries. Any tips regarding training plans, recovery sessions or even meal plans are very welcome!

running,"Hey guys. So I'm fairly new to running, well at the volume I have been since March. I would say I run 3-5 miles a day. I have been told I overpronate (at Running Store treadmill test) and have always stuck with Brooks Adrenaline or Kayano Asics shoes. 

Recently I have been having such tight pain in my right ankle that I'd need to rub or have rubbed to be released. Come to find out after some research I have a bunch of knots in my ankle ! and most likely peroneal tendonitis or tendinopathy(sp). And I also am not sure if I actually overpronate, I have high arches, which is usually associated with supinating from what I've read.

So now I am trying out multiple neutral shoes to try out and see if I can switch. However I'm not sure if I need a low or a high drop. And these shoes are causing me some more pain in legs and knee some. 

So at the time of this post since covid is just burning through the US I thought I would be wise to not go to running store / PT / podiatrist or whomever, and maybe wait a little bit of time on that.

running,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit as I'm not sure what this injury is, but here goes. First some details about me:

Started running to lose weight, without any real knowledge so I just did that for a year 6 days a week between 6-8 km a day and did a few half marathons. Then reduced that to 1/2 a week as I started doing more weight training for another year. 

So... About half a year ago, I started having pain at my left outer knee. First couple of weeks it would feel like it would pop in and out of socket along with pain while walking, bending the knee, going up and down the stairs, squatting etc.

Naturally I went to my doctor, he did all his tests and said there was no damage to my bands and whatnot. Next stop physical therapist, he concluded it had to with the way I walk, supposedly I land on the side of my feed rather than on my heel and then using my big toe, and this is something that could build up for years and suddenly you'd just feel the pain? So he recommended podiatric orthotics. I've been using them for 12 weeks now, very slowly feeling less pain. But whenever I engage in any activity, irritating my knee like a couple of air squats, it just feels like I lost weeks in progress the next day in terms of pain. And so as a result I just haven't trained my legs or went for a jog in half a year. I went to a different physical therapist last week and she felt like it had to do with an immobility of my hip, so my knee is compensating. 

Now by no means am I qualified to make this call and Googling your own symptoms is usually a bad idea, but I came across ITBS yesterday and I was just so surprised that neither one of my PTs mentioned this to me. 

I just feel like it's taking a very long time without much progress and it shouldn't take this long to heal.

Hi guys,

First post from a fairly novice runner. 

Bit of background on me. I’m a 35 year old male and I’ve been running seriously about 10 months and run about 60k/5 hours per week. 

Upto now I haven't really had a meticulous or structured training method or looked into it. I just have the go hard or go home mentality and push myself. 

Ive got to the stage where I can run 5k in 19 and a half minutes and 10k in 41 minutes. I can also run upto 27k at 4.45 per Km pace. 

I’ve recently had a HR max test which has revealed I have max HR of 190 and a VO2 max of 55. It also shows that I have a weak aerobic system and I’ve been told to train at level 2 to improve this. 

This means training at a HR of around 130bpm. I’ve tried this and I’m literally walking fast. If I jog my HR is to high. It feels far to easy and I’m worried that it will be a waste of time. I appreciate that if I kept this up I would see an improvement in my low HR aerobic performance but does this really matter? 

Does anyone have any info on this please. It would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks guys.",Level 2 HR training....help me plz,Cocoloco19844,1608506990,2020-12-20 23:29:50

\- reliability and durability to some extent (even though i would prefer to get a really light watch)

\- long battery life

With the year we've had though, many who want to really get into running were sedentary most of the year and just getting out and running seems like a really good idea...until we get out and realise we can't just *do it* yet.

 I know there are a lot of posts and guides here about ""how do I start running/I've never run before/ What program should I use"". In my experience most of the programs and advice, while they are very good programs and advice for beginner runners, can be a bit far-fetched for someone who truly and genuinely never ran a day in their life. Personally, as wonderful as the C25K program is, it felt waaaay too hard in the beginning and I dreaded every day I had to train. I didn't understand why I was having trouble running when I've danced and ""gym""ed my whole life. I was physically strong and considerably fit, but the problem was, as I learned after quitting the program twice, my muscles were not used to be being used like that and hurt because I was pushing them too fast. That, plus my asthma really kept calling me out 10 seconds into every jog for doing the utmost. I wasn't ready to just start jogging and running from week one. 

So this is what I did instead. I hope that this can help someone who is in the same place I was: mentally you want to run, but physically you just can't get it done yet. Consider this the bridge between truly couch potato-ing and starting a run program. I also appreciate any discussion or critique of the methods I used as I am still in the phase of trying to get my muscles used to being used without pushing my lungs too hard.

Instead of forcing myself to make a new habit, I picked a habit that already existed for me: I usually walk in a circle around the outside of my house (it's one of my autistic compulsions) 4 times every day. Now, I put on my shoes each time I do that, which triggers a new cue to prepare to run, and the response became that on at least one of those trips I follow my ""Bridge Plan"" instead. I am able to satisfy the craving and reward myself without disrupting my routine too much. The craving is to move around (which is easier outside than inside) and the reward I guess is some kind of happy hormone I don't naturally have enough of. As I said, I'm not a doctor LOL. 

# Listen to your body

Now about the actual routine. All of my ""workouts"" have been done to a mixture of time and distance. It takes me about 12 minutes, or 3 1/2 songs, to briskly walk one kilometre (0.6miles). There's also a sort of park-like area 1km from my house. Using this I devised time and physical markers for the journey, eg, a 15-minute walk is to a particular house that is just over halfway, and back home; 25 minutes is to the park and back home; 35 minutes is to the park, one lap around the 2 football fields, and back home, etc. The workout looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Week|Sunday|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|rest|25min|15min|25min|rest|15min|35min|
|2|rest|30min|20min|30min|rest|20min|35min|
|3|rest|30min|25min|30min|rest|25min|40min|
|4|rest|35min|25min|35min|rest|25min|45min|
|5|rest|35min|25min|35min|15min|25min|45min|
|6|rest|35min|25min|35min|25min|45min|25min|

My hope is that after week 6 I can substitute the 30min+ walks for walk/jogs until I am able to walk/jog every scheduled day. It may not happen that quickly and I may still come back to this walking after a week on C25K if my body says to. By this time next year though, I hope I can have a habit of easily running these times without stopping! 

Some other links that helped me in planning were choosing playlists that fit the [BPM](https://walk.jog.fm/workout-songs) of my walking cadence and a [pedometer map](https://www.mappedometer.com/) to help me see the distances of landmarks in my area.

Since October i started doing more (pretty much only) zone 2 runs. I try to stick to it through the winter to build good base before spring and some speed workouts then.

I noticed something worrying though when looking through my records. My heart rate was more stable and lower in October than it is now! Of course it was but perfect, but more stable definitely. Clearly visible on plots. My pace did not improve too.

That goes against everything i read/saw on internet, i expected at least some zone 2 pace improvements and lower/stable HR. Instead now my heart can stick to zone 2 for 5 minutes and then jump up. I take walk break for 30-60s, it drops, i can run for few minutes and it goes back up.

I'm using the same hr monitor- mi band 5. While not perfect, it seems good enough and i would expect it didn't break or anything.

running,"TLDR --&gt; Here is a free analytics web app that syncs with strava. Estimates your Aerobic fitness, training load and generates personalized running programs for you based on your past activities

[Pictures of the app](https://www.imgur.com/gallery/L8zb81V)

2 months ago i launched an analytics webapp that syncs with strava, the project is called  [Leading Pace](https://www.leadingpace.net/login) and the results were mixed. Although most users didn't have a problem using the app, a big number of people reported bugs errors or complete inability to use the app. However i got mostly good feedback so i went back to working and rewriting my app.

Now i am back, **the app is completely written from the begining using modern single page app frameworks and is tens times faster**. I worked on a lot of reported bugs and i hope the experience will be better than the previous time.

I am sure that a lot of errors will happen as i currently have a very limited user base, so i hope that you will help me accelarate the development phase.

# ! IMPORTANT ! You can use your old profiles as the database is intact. But now you should login using your email not your username

# So let's start from the beginning for people than didn't saw my previous post.

&amp;#x200B;

The web app is called [Leading Pace](https://www.leadingpace.net/login). You can either import activities manually or sync from strava. The project is in early access phase which means that is completely functional but corrections happen every day

[Pictures of the app](https://www.imgur.com/gallery/L8zb81V)

Features

* Vo2max and aerobic fitness estimation
* Training load ( fitness , fatigue levels estimation)
* weekly/monthly/yearly mileage linear or rolling
* Personalized running programs based on your past activities, aerobic fitness , fatigue estimation. Basically the app estimates your training speeds on different heart rate zones and tells you exactly how far how long and in what speed to run.
* peak performance , distance readiness , race times estimation
* Exclude activities from your fitness estimation if you think that an activity is not representative of your fitness
* Training zones estimation ( karvonen formula )

The app currently supports strava imports but i am considering adding more options soon. Also only running activities are supported by the moment, soon cycling and swimming.

The app is free! Feel free to sign up and contact me for any potential feedback ( positive or not! )

join in [r/leadingpace](https://www.reddit.com/r/leadingpace/)

* **! IMPORTANT !. If you need to change your max hr rest hr or lactate threshold do it BEFORE importing activities. changing this metrics after importing wont recalculate your stats for older activities , it will only apply for new activities. This is not a bug there is a reason it works that way!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Check here first if you have any issues

**If strava fails to sync activities make sure that**

* you dont have a second account. If you have already an account synced with strava and now you create a second one, while importing the app will consider the activities duplicates and will fail. So if you already have an account use this account or send me a message for a possible deletion
* you have running activities in strava. The app currently supports only activities with type ""run""
* your activities have heart rate data. Although not all activities should have heart rate data the app needs heart rate data for most of its functions.
* de auth and then auth again.   if the problem persists send me a message or reply here
* take some time off and come back later. Strava is rate limiting requests from new app and it is entirely possible due to high traffic to reach the limit( the limit is per 15 minutes and 1 hour )

**if your estimated performance,Vo2max,speeds seems off**

* set your correct Max hr,Rest hr and lactate threshold values BEFORE importing activities. If you fail to do that delete all activities change the above values and resync
* excude from fitness estimation through training history page all activities that

1. duration is shorter than 15 minutes
2. activitiy is extreme uphill or downhill especially if it is not symetrical
3. activities with faulty heart rate data
4. activities that contain a lot of walking segments ( run-walk programs like c25k)
5. for any other reason you think an activity is not representative of your overall fitness

**if training program seems off**

* check firstly if any of the above apply to your problem
* running program needs a lot of activities to estimate your aerobic fitness and fatigue levels and training habbits. If you don't put enough training data the app can't work properly
* if you have running activities without heart rate data the app will still import them but they will be excluded from aerobic fitness as they don't provide enough data. If a lot of your activities don't contain heart rate data the running program will be off
* right now the app supports only run activities (soon cycling, swimming) if you have a lot of not run type activities in the last two months you may have higher aerobic fitness than the ones the app predicts. So the program will be underestimating your condition. This is were intensity factor comes to play, feel free to increase the intesity of the program initialy until you find the sweet spot

# A note about feedback

All feedback is valuable possitive or not, but last time a small portion of people sent me borderline agressive and hateful pms about the app not being good enough or having bugs.

Basically, I have been running on and off for the last 10 years (am 25f, 120lbs). This year I was able to resume running after a 2 year break (yay, law school). In May I ran my first 5k in a few years, with a speed of 36:59. This morning, my 5k speed was 26:47.

My 10k time started off as about 73 minutes, but is now down to about 65 minutes. However, this speed has not changed at all over the last 2-3 months.

I do a long run once a week (between 10k and 12k), and do a 5k every week too. I used to do 2x 10ks and a 5k every week, but have had to drop the second 10k due to work as I simply do not have the time at the moment due to work and ensuring I keep up with my martial arts classes.

My 5k speeds have not stopped improving, but my 10k speeds seem to have totally stagnated and for the life of me I can't get them any lower. Its a little frustrating and I don't understand why. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions as to what this could be?

I also believe that my shoes might not have been suitable for my arches (or lack of, rather). 

I hobbled through a week and a half of work in agony hoping that it was something that would fix itself but coming up two weeks now of that not happening, I’ve had to give in and phone a doctor and take sick leave from work to have consistent rest days. I managed to get a phone consultation to speak to a physio before Christmas and, for the time being, I’ve been icing my knees and shins, taking painkillers and attempting to do stretches in hope of relieving the pain.

The pain in my knees has subsided from how bad it was prior to taking sick leave; however, it’s travelled round to the inner area of both knees and it doesn’t seem to want to budge (the best way I can describe the exact location is the area that touches when you stand with your legs together). Combined with those damn shin splints, it’s uncomfortable to say the least - especially at night. 

As I mentioned, I’ve been icing it and then switching between heat with hot baths and heat packs and it’s helping to relieve the pain, though not for long. I also attempt to do two or three stretching sessions during the day. On top of that, I’ve been using creams (deep heat, deep freeze, etc.) but I don’t feel as if it touches the pain whatsoever. 

Until I’m able to speak to the physio, I was wondering if someone could recommend a particular stretch for this area or anything else that might help to ease the pain. The reason I ask is because I feel that stretches helped to subside the original all-over pain; however, I can’t quite seem to find one that gets to where I need it to.

running,"Basic background:
Female, 27, running for around 4 years.
Used to run 3x per week with a 6mile run on a weekend as my long run.
Due to serious injury and nearly 9 months off running, I now do 3x runs per week - 2 are between 2-3 mile and long run is about 5 mile. 
This has been my routine since summer and suits my needs.

Recently my long run has been increasing difficult. Everything feels heavy, I get tired easily, mentally it’s hard to push myself. I struggle to hit 2 miles but the weekday runs are still between 2-3 miles and feel relatively easy. 

The difference between prep is on a weekday I get up at 5.30 have a coffee, and run at 6. 

On a weekend I get up, eat a light breakfast for fuel have coffee and run 1/1.5 hours later. 

How do I get back up to a decent distance at the weekend and overcome how hard it feels?

running,"For all my childhood, I really hated running and dreaded the P.E. tests.

Usually, I was the slower fatter kid that got 12.5 minute miles. 

Cut to college, I decided to take up running, since I read that sedentary lifestyles such as sitting in an office would increase risk of early heart disease.

Knowing that I hated running, I still tried.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months, I fell into a nice routine of a good 3 miles per run, and 3 runs per week.

Maybe it was the route I took that had minimal street intersections, but that was the max distance I usually took.

And right now, I regret not going farther and farther, like when I see people here run 10 miles in one go.

Zoning out in my runs and just letting my legs do the work was the best part, with the music too.

On the off-chance I developed symptoms of a cold, i.e. sore throat, runny nose, etc, I would look forward to a run to speed up the recovery and feel great after, rejuvinated.

Now, it seems a possibly permanent injury prevents me from running more than a mile at best.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, the job I took involved some heavy lifting, and the rate they had us work at was demoralizing.

Over 10 hours of lifting crates of water bottles, reams of paper, and rolls of toilet paper wasn't what did it.

Reality was, it was a singular accident on the knee.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, it seemed to heal alright for a while after.

You couldn't believe I actually fell and smashed my inner knee into what was essentially a block of metal.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much though, I vowed to never shop with this company again.

Especially when I found out the same happened to others, told to work through an injury.

Read the same articles so many times with different names in different locations.

My knee would have been fine for life, but now I'll never know.

As someone desperate for a job during pandemic, I decided to take on a similar job in the same company.

Now due to the even heavier nature of the items, I realized my movements aggravated my injury I thought had totally healed.

Eventually, moving a 400 pound cart placed probably some lateral stress on my knee, and now, it hurts.

Now, when I run, I find that I can't run the full three miles.

Two and a half miles in the knee hurts like shockwaves.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing I wanted to run, I try again.

Now, it hurts after two miles.

Ensue my third try, it hurt after a mile and a half.

Ensue my fourth try, it hurts after a mile, but I still finish another mile on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Imbecilic mistake.

Now, I'm thinking of seeing an appointment with a doctor/kinesiologist and hoping that this issue isn't forever.

Just a dumb fall, and my plans to maintain mobility from college years to way past retirement are now ruined.

Understand one reason I ran was to defy the future aging process that confines my grandmother to a wheelchair as you are reading this now.

Really sucks for me right now, and it's a sad thing when I can't really run, not for fun, or even to avoid a criminal/robber, or even run to help someone.

You probably don't see the big message I'm trying to share, so read the first letter of every sentence.

running,"So for context, I started running this year and have been loving it. I started with some standard Nikes and they were alright, but Im a pretty big person (started at 300, now about 250), and they just didnt quite work out for me. I got some Brooks GTS 20s in July and fell in love, they made running way easier and I felt incredible after. 

My original pair still has some life left in it, but I bought a second pair in October since they went on sale and I figured I would need them eventually. I ended up getting rona'd in October so I didnt get around to using the shoes for a while, but I could tell they felt different when taking a few walks in November. Since then, Ive been doing shorter 2-3 mile runs in them and taking ~2 mile walks a couple days a week, but they have absolutely been killing my feet. It feels like the front of them is rock solid. I am actually taking a break from running for a week or so now to recover and I plan on going back to my original pair for a while. I can feel my right foot (where a lot of the problems are) sits differently in the new pair, as it sorta slides inwards whenever I take any kind of step, whereas they sit firmly in the original pair I had.

Im not really sure what to do here, so I was hoping someone could give me some tips on breaking them in or trying to make the new shoes more tolerable. They were a pretty big expense for me, so I really dont want to have to buy another pair so soon or get rid of these, but Im also not really sure what to do since they arent even comfortable for walking, and Im definitely outside of the return window.",Issues Breaking In New Shoes?

running,"Be really careful switching to barefoot running! 

I switched gradually, I introduced it at a rate that I thought was conservative. Nope. I got stress fractures in both Tibias. It was initially misdiagnosed and has had complications since being correctly diagnosed. It is an unbelievable frustrating amd difficult thing to recover. It overstresses the bones just to stand up. Healing is slow. Its slooooow. And when you overdo it, you probably wont feel it until the next day when you realize you just reset yourself back 2 weeks just by walking up the stairs too many times. If I had just snapped both Tibias in half, I would have been healed by now and back to running. I havent run for 6 months and as it is, I have bone pain every day and cant even walk on both feet for 10 minutes without doing damage. Every day I want to bang my head into the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

**Abstract**
Fair warning I have a feeling this post is going to turn into a novel and admittedly outside of the general/vague goals I'll let before I just have ""ideas"" -- I would consider myself a beginner/novice as I'm decades removed from running, but admittedly ran at fairly high level (varsity HS XC, made it to state, tons of 5k/10k/halves and was competitive but knew my limitations which were, I wasn't on the same level as the top 10% of runners). 

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the ideas I've been considering are a marathon before my 38th birthday (or an ultra) - or maybe really start trying to work on dropping times and see what I can do speed wise. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Goals** (Yes I know this are vague/weak):

1. Enjoy every run in some capacity
2. Listen to what my body wants do do that
3. Stay pain/injury free
4. Try to run daily if/when possible (i usually only hit 4-6 runs a week)

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Did I Stop Running**

I have family in Colorado Springs and during my peak years would often go out there to visit them. My uncle who has always been in ridiculous triathlete shape convinced me to sign up for the Pikes Peak Ascent (the half marathon straight up). The year I did it I as in the kind of shape where clicking off 13.1 at a competitive pace was a cake walk. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Ascent humbled me in 2001/2002 (I know it was around my senior year). I went out about 6 weeks before to get acclimated to the altitude. Did a lot of elevation gain runs and thought I was good to go. Upon the start of the race I quickly learned I was not. It was the most brutal run of my life. I actually sat down at a certain spot above the tree line and mentally thought ""if this is my time to go, this is my time to go""

&amp;nbsp;

That race killed running for me. Prior to that race I routinely got the ""runners high"" and generally enjoyed all runs, after that it was non-existent

&amp;nbsp;

**The Beginning**

I've tried to get back into running the last 15 years several times via brute force but never enjoyed it, but that changes in 2020.

&amp;nbsp;

During the pandemic with the lack of social interaction I was one of those people that found solace in physical activity and being outdoors. My main sport my entire life was basketball but I had gotten away from that, and there's a bunch of outdoor courts right now the street - so I started just shooting around solo. The courts were always my safe space / my therapy growing up and it just felt right. A while in I decided to go for a run. The running didn't stick but I averaged probably 2-3 hours on the court over the summer.

&amp;nbsp;

**First Pathetic Attempt**
My first attempt at running was in May30th and I didn't even make it a mile. It was 0.85mi at 10:56 pace
https://imgur.com/BT5yf15

&amp;nbsp;

**The Change**

I went for a run in September and everything felt different, the base conditioning from basketball got me to where i clicked of a 5k with ease (very slow time).....but more importantly the runners high was back and I as hooked. What I've done

**So What is the Point of This Post - THE ASK**

&amp;nbsp;

I've done everything above with completely zero training plan. I just run, listen to my body, blast some music and have fun. If my body wants it to be low/slow day it is, if my body pulls are Ricky Bobby like that 7:21 10th mile above I let it rip. I have an amazing knack for jumping to hard into training plans whether it be running/lifting/anything and immediately getting burnt out or getting hurt. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What would you do?** I'm loving running with zero plans. I don't want to lose the joy of running.  When I leave I never know if is going to be a 2mile run or 10-14mile, I also never know what the pace is going to be I just let my body go. 

&amp;nbsp;

Goal 1: Finish (Yes)

Goal 2: Run the whole thing without walking (no)

After almost a year of seriously getting into running again, and seeing my running buddies run multiple marathons since August while I still struggled getting past a half marathon, I finally did the damn thing and ran my first full marathon this morning at the local state park with two of my buddies. Little did I know, I was setting myself up for a hard and very hilly time (1300+ feet of elevation gain. It was rough). I really wanted to run the whole thing, but at least run the first 20. I was so ready to quit at mile 17 (which the mental difficulty has always been one of my biggest barriers) but I pushed it through to 20 miles, then took my first walking break for a few minutes. At that point, the thought of even walking 6.2 more miles seemed impossible. But I worked out a good system where I'd walk 0.2 miles, then run 0.8. Up until mile 24, I was really struggling. But then I got to my car, took a break to grab my water and carry it with me when I walked. Even better, the sun came out, and I felt better than I did all day. The last 2.2 miles were great, and my only regret is walking my last section of 0.2 instead of just running the last two miles nonstop, which I could've. I even finished only 6 minutes behind my buddies who were with me the whole way until I started walking. My legs are dead, but I feel alive. Next marathon, I'm going somewhere much flatter.

running,"Hi!

29 yo, baseline of ~75k/week, and 10k @39:00

I have two loves in my life: running and lifting. After six months of prioritizing running, it's time to shift focus toward lifting. 

I've recently started with 5/3/1 and Boring But Big, and that leaves me completely gassed. I know that the high volumes of BBB (5*10 reps @50% aften main sets) isn't the smartest thing to do if you also want to run, but I think It's super fun to do, and also I'm curious to see if I might get some of all the promised gains.

Usually I've quite easily been running 75-80k/week, with two workouts and one long run. Since I've started 5/3!1+BBB, almost all my workouts have been crap, and I've been struggling to hit my weekly target mileage. Also my knee has started to hurt..

I've therefore come to peace with stepping down the ambitions for running for a while. But I don't want to lose fitness.. Preferably, I would like to jeep improving, even if It's just a tint bit here and there. Is that Even possible? 

I've read that it's key not dropping the mileage to much, and also keeping some intensity. But not VO2, that's too taxing, and can either way quickly be compensated for later.

Does a mileage of 60-70k/week, one long run, and one shorter (20-30 min) and not that intense tempo run week sound like an ok plan? And maybe up mileage and adding a second workout during deload weeks (every fourth week). Are there better ways to dont loose fitness/still managing to make small improvements (if that's even possible?)?

running,"Looking for some thoughts/feedback/tips from anyone who has had a metatarsal stress fracture or a medical professional or trainer who's familiar with this injury. 

I was diagnosed with a stress fracture at the base of the right second metatarsal and a stress reaction to the first metatarsal base and distal cuneiform about a week and a half ago. The pain started suddenly during a run in mid October (the last time i ran)-I stopped running but continued to take long walks and exercise using an aerobic step. Initially my foot felt better but over time the pain worsened prompting me to see a podiatrist-nothing was noted on an X-ray so an MRI was ordered which picked up the injury. 

I'm on crutches with no weight bearing for a minimum of 3-4 weeks (it's about a week and a half in at this point). I'm not even allowed to use a stationary bike right now. This is driving me crazy as I'm used to being an active person. 

I am 48 and have been running since I was 15 and aside from having plantar fasciitis in my right foot in the late Spring and early Summer I've never been injured. Prior to the injury, I was actually running less than I used to-about 3 or 4 fairly slow paced miles typically 3 or 4 days a week. The days I didn't run I exercised with an aerobic step for about 45 minutes to an hour per day. In addition to running and doing the aerobic step in the morning, I walked about 30 minutes in the evening most days per week. On the weekends instead of running or using the aerobic step I'd hike anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours. I also lift light weights (8 lbs to 15 lbs) about 2 days per week and stand intermittently throughout the day at work (I have a desk that I can adjust from sitting to standing). 

I'm trying to figure out what caused the injury and how to prevent it in the future. I would love to rehab faster but everything I've read states that it takes time and you have to rest. When I had plantar fasciitis in May/June, I switched to the very heavily padded Hoka One One Bondi shoes (I was wearing Asics). By September when it was time for me to replace my shoes, I thought it would be better for me to switch back to a less heavily padded shoe. I went to a running shop and they recommended Saucony Guide 13's which I was wearing when I first noticed the pain in October. 

Could it be a gait change due to Plantar's that trigged the fracture? The change in shoes? My age catching up with me? I didn't have a sudden increase in activity-I've been exercising like this for years. My diet is good but as a result of the injury I've increased my calcium and Vitamin D.

running,"A year ago I started running after most of my life focusing on weightlifting and being ""generally athletic"". At the outset, I focused mostly on doing heart-rate based training and only in the late spring/summer did I incorporate hill training and some interval work. Fast forward to the end of July this year and I had built up to (a pretty slow) 15 miles for my long weekend run. I turned 40 years old this past summer so was happy with my progress and set a goal to run a marathon in late winter of 2021.  


In late November/early December, I had some (mostly minor) IT band issues that I wanted to pay attention to before they got worse so I reduced mileage significantly for 3-4 weeks and incorporated more [strength work like this](https://coachjayjohnson.com/samvidoes/) and some kettlebell and light deadlifting. Now I'm trying to slowly increase my mileage back up but my heartrate is just through the roof all the time as I run so I keep cutting my runs short thinking my body is trying to tell me I'm doing too much. I also just feel pretty ""out of shape"" more than feeling fresh and good to go. I can't piece together any other factors that would be causing this—sleep is generally good, work stress is manageable, etc.   


Is this just part of the process to have to start over again after a few weeks mostly off? Since I'm new to running, the question of **""Am I just not meant to be a runner?""** inevitably pops into my head.

running,"I found out I was lucky enough to lottery into the 2021 Berlin Marathon next September - it'll be my first marathon ever, so whatever time I run will automatically be a PR. 

That being said, I still want to focus on performing as strongly as possible. How do I reasonably set a goal time here, knowing that 1) I've never run the marathon distance before and 2) it's still more nine months away? 

If it helps: I'm currently at 35 mpw (a mix of long, easy, and speed runs) and have recent time trials of 5:47 in the mile and 19:54 in the 5k. The right answer here very well might be ""don't think about a goal time until spring"", but I would like to set a reasonably ambitious target as a kind of psychological carrot-on-stick for myself.","How do you set a goal for a totally new race distance, one year away?",straightfreshtodeath,1608396202,2020-12-19 16:43:22

running,"I was/am planning on going for my first 13.1 distance on New Year's Day and somehow I've messed up my ankle. I did a 10 miler last Monday. Cross trained Tuesday and did ~18 miles on my bike. Wednesday I literally sat on my ass all day. Thursday I did 5 miles on the treadmill, which was a struggle but I figured it's because I was close to my uh...lady time. I didn't have pain, just tired. Felt fine after the run, but that night I noticed a pain in my ankle when I point my toes downwards. I'm also getting a twinge when I put pressure on the balls of my foot. It's still sore two days later...

I've always been very conservative when it comes to training to avoid injury, so this is a first for me.

I read online that it's actually better to alternate your running shoes so I bought a Hoka Clifton 7 and a Asics Gel Nimbus 22, and my first few runs in both of these shoes have been refreshing. I've been running way faster than in my old Zoom Fly 3s and it feels less laboring to run the usual 8-9 miles in them. Is this just a placebo or does the age of the shoe really make a huge difference? I only ask because I've seen people run their shoes until the upper rips.

Also a secondary question is how often should I alternate the running shoes? I read that you have to let the foam in the shoes rest in order to maximize their life so I try to run 2 days in a row and then alternate.

running,"I usually love giving running advice to other people but this time around, I'm stuck. I've never been pregnant before. I'm currently coming up on 16 weeks. I finally have enough energy to walk up and down the stairs at home, walk around my neighborhood, do maybe 15 min of yoga, etc. I feel day by day I am getting better.

My quick history:

1. Two years ago I ran my first and second marathon in the same year, before that I ran a handful of halfs and I have a special fondness for the 5K and 10K. I'm not a pro, think at my peak I was only 50 miles/week), but I love committing to a training plan, reaching goals and the meditation that is going outside for a run. Basically have been running since Jr High more or less.
2. It took us about a year to get pregnant which was emotionally devastating, and to top it off, in an effort to regulate my hormones, I reduced my running load significantly to where I would never run for more than 45 minutes in a stretch and limited to three or four days a week. Eventually it worked because I got a regular cycle back and woo for now being pregnant.
3. I was running about 1-2 miles daily and doing daily yoga practice up through 6-7 weeks pregnant but then things started to take a real turn. I think I had somewhat severe morning sickness. I lost 15 lbs, I was mostly bed-ridden, lots of vomiting, migraines, not really eating anything, trouble staying hydrated, the whole bit. So obviously not running at this time. I became a vegetable.
4. **Two months later**, I'm getting my energy back and noticing all the things I know running would help me with: going to the bathroom daily, sleeping better at night, easing my restless legs, feeling good about myself, getting outside and having me time and achieving some small goal.

I've been reading other pregnancy forums, everyone says just keep to ""gentle exercise."" Running is not really on that list. The problem is I'm worried about how to start, but I know my body and my mind don't want to give it up. I literally have dreams that I'm going out for runs and enjoying life. I've never had a true ""couch to 5K"" because I've always been doing SOMETHING on the side to maintain general fitness.

running,"Hey! 

Hope this is appropriate. I'm doing the C25K and I'm in week 5 where the 20min run is scheduled and I just can't seem to do it. I've been trying for 2 weeks now. 

The thing is I'm comfortable doing 2x10min and have been doing so last week in preparation. And 4x5 min is no problem either. But every time I attempt the 20min I just give up, sometimes even before 10min are over. Sometimes I'm not even out of breath but doubt just creeps into my head and makes me stop. 

How do I overcome this?",How to get past mental barrier and finally run for 20min?,Xierrax,1608301330,2020-12-18 14:22:10
running,"Hey,

So I started running during lockdown period (more as proof to my partner's family that I could do a sub 30 5k). Got a bit addicted and started on a goal to break 25 minutes. I've always played sports so I've been pretty fit over the years, however, I'm not in the shape I once was and now getting hardly any sleep (thanks, kids!) it's been hard to maintain.

I pushed myself with 2-3 runs a week and tried to get faster every time. It was hard work but eventually it felt better and I was slowly shaving my time down. I was averaging the late 26s recently and after a super hard push I managed to run a sub 25 5k for the first time ever. 

I decided that after hitting that goal I would try to keep running for fitness. I'm not sure if it is a lack of motivation, my running shoes, my chest or what but ever since then it's been really difficult. Even at a comfortable pace I find myself gassing early (especially between around 2.5k-4k) before I get a second wind to finish the run.

A few guys at work are also running and one who was miles slower than me decided to stop trying 5ks and started increasing his distance and now he comfortably does 10 mile runs with really good times.

What can be causing this gassed out feeling I get, my lower legs feel the run really early these days and I feel like it's ridiculous to go from being able to do 5k in under 27 minutes and feeling good to really struggling to hit 28 and feeling gassed.

I've had a slight cough lately (nothing covid related) and wonder if I am carrying a little chest bug but doubt that would be the only reason.

Thanks for any suggestions!",How can I get my times back up and not being completely gassed?,skjohnsen1,1608299420,2020-12-18 13:50:20

running,"As a 39 year old female whose average 5k time has stayed pretty steady at 29:00ish for years (with one exceptional race at 26:58 in 2013), would it be possible to shave off 3 minutes by the end of next year?  I want to do a sub 26:00 5k at the age of 40.  Right now I can maintain my goal pace for about 1 mile.  So I have been doing my ""normal"" 3 mile runs 4 or 5 days a week and then ending the run with an extra 4th ""fast"" mile.  

Obviously running longer distances will help my speed.  Any other small tips/tricks that might help me knock off some time?  I have always wondered how I could be so lean (135lb and 5'8"") but run so slow!   Lol.  Recently I have learned I have b-vitamin and iron deficiency, so I am hoping that correcting this will at least help a little.  

The only other thing that I can think is keeping me ""slow"" is my complete lack of glutes and hamstrings....no calves either, but my abs and thighs are overdeveloped.  I definitely have a wacky stride due to muscle imbalance....maybe a physiotherapist could help me correct my issues?
