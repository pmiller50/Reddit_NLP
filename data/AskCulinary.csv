AskCulinary,"Dear nakamas,

I have recently bought my first apartment and I am in the middle of renovating my favourite spot of the house: the kitchen. After buying a nifty induction hot plate I am in the middle of buying the pots and pans. 

After having read basically a ton of content I understand that once you have selected good brands much of the pots and pans selection goes down to personal preference, design, type of cooking etc.

In the past years I have done my fair share of cooking on very basic cooking equipment but the current situation gives me a shot to finally care enough to buy some nice tools.

**Pots:** After much thought I have bought Alessi's Mami set ([https://alessi.com/products/mami-set-di-pentole-7-pezzi](https://alessi.com/products/mami-set-di-pentole-7-pezzi)) because 1) works on induction plates, 2) look very cool and homely, 3) Alessi is well known for the quality of their products.

**Pans:** I am now looking for a good set of pans. 

The goal is to have something that:

1.  looks ""homely"" (I am not a fan of the ""industrial"", black / teflon look on the outside of the pan) and goes well with the ""Mami"" set,
2. has good cooking properties (non-stick, or as little as possible, good heat transmission etc.) and 
3. is not hard to manage (e.g. copper pans).

I cook a bit of everything but mainly Italian, French and English dishes—no need for a Wok for now. 

Do you have any piece of advice?

I love the design of Zara Home's pans but they lack the non-stick coating ([https://www.zarahome.com/fr/en/kitchen/kitchenware/stainless-steel-frying-pan-(24-cm)-c1020235062p301746854.html?ct=true](https://www.zarahome.com/fr/en/kitchen/kitchenware/stainless-steel-frying-pan-(24-cm)-c1020235062p301746854.html?ct=true)) and like Pensofal's pans ([https://pensofal.com/products/invictum-set-9-pz?lang=en](https://pensofal.com/products/invictum-set-9-pz?lang=en)) but I am not sure about their durability.

AskCulinary,"I want to preface with the fact that I hate bacon that’s too crispy and the line between burned and perfect is just so thin — I really struggle with it.

Tonight, I cut up some bacon for a pasta dish and cooked it on the stovetop (medium to medium low). I expected the carry over heat to crisp them up but, after cooking my greens, I noticed they still weren’t the deep red color I’m accustomed to. I threw the bacon back in the pan for a couple of mins, hoping that would cook them through. 

Then I threw in the pasta, pasta water, and cream to make the sauce. It all sat in the pan for a while, as I sporadically stirred. I figured, by the end, the bacon should be fine. Then, after eating a bit, I noticed that many of the bacon bits were pretty opaque. I know that’s fat but does that indicate that it’s undercooked? 

I use my thermometer to check the internal temp of everything but bacon just seems impossible to get an accurate read on. I know chances are the bacon was cooked through since it also sat in the pot with the pasta for a while (maybe 8 mins) but... if the fat is still opaque, does that mean it’s unsafe?",Bacon — how to know if it’s fully cooked?,Midwestviawestcoast,1609216450,2020-12-29 04:34:10

AskCulinary,"I'm looking for a good Western replacement for a [karai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karahi), an all-purpose pan used in most South Asian cuisines. The ideal karai:

1. **Has a wok-like shape.** Curved sides are required for tossing and stir-frying, and the sides must be high enough to pour in liquid to boil a curry.

2. **Can withstand very high heat.** We use oils with a high smoke point to temper spices and aromatics for an unique flavor.

3. **Is naturally stick-resistant.** Definitely not as slick as Teflon, but kadais are naturally nonstick enough to fry skin-on fish without the skin separating from the fillet.

4. **Can handle boiling acidic liquids.** Many curries contain tomato or citrus and are boiled for 30min or longer.

The materials I've tried are missing one of these. Teflon is out because it leeches at high heat. Ceramic nonstick is better, but after a few times on high heat, the coating degrades.

Typically I sweat a shallot, sometimes with mushrooms, sometimes garlic, deglaze with dry white wine, reduce. Sometimes then add some stock (actually Better Than Bouillon; I've been meaning to get to the local bulk foods store to buy some unflavored gelatin to add to it) and reduce again. Then usually stir in some dijon, and finish either with butter or a little full fat Greek yogurt thinned with water (I don't keep cream, and this simulates it just fine in every application I've tried it in).

6 Tablespoons Salted Butter

1 Medium Yellow Onion

1 Tablespoon plus 1 Teaspoon of  Sweet Paprika

2 Teaspoons Ground Cumin

1 cup Red Lentils

2 Teaspoons of Salt

Bing Pinch of Red Pepper Flakes

4 1/2 Cups of Water

Then you stir in the paprika, cumin, lentils, water, and salt and let it simmer for two minutes. After that you take the three other tablespoons of butter melt it in a small skillet with the rest of the Paprika and some red pepper flakes and add that to the soup after it is done simmering.

This recipe seems like it would be a salt bomb to me, but at the same time it kind of makes sense to add a bunch of salt if you don't have a stock.

AskCulinary,"CW: microwaving cooked scallops 😳

My parents are planning to order expensive prix fixe dinners from a local restaurant for New Year’s Eve.

The only problem is this dinner is takeout (Covid), and the pickup time is scheduled for 3:30pm, which my parents consider too early for dinner.

The meals include items such as ribeye steak and scallops, which are obviously best enjoyed immediately after they are served. I suggested we eat right after we pick up the food, but they insist that we eat ~2 hours later.

They called the kitchen to ask the best way to reheat the food, and were told to microwave in short bursts to avoid cooking anything further. If I were to cook a meal like that, I would be almost offended if someone refrigerated it and heated it up later in a microwave.

I’m no chef but I know that microwaves can’t help but alter the texture and consistency of delicate ingredients.

My question: am I being too nitpicky? Are there better ways to save the food for later consumption? Will microwaving my scallops ruin them?

When I buy a bag of chile (say, ancho or pasilla) and first open it, the fruits are dry but still pliable, and thus easy to de-seed.

I’ve always been too food-safe concerned to try with raw egg, and after getting a sous vide for Christmas I decided to try a Hugh Acheson recipe for Mayo.

I watched videos on this before, and I know how important it is to add the oil slowly to prevent breaking. I did it by hand with a whisk rather than a food processor. It turned out alright, but the consistency was more like ketchup or mustard rather than the bottled mayo, I couldn’t get it to form peaks.

Thoughts on how to thicken it more? One comment somewhere said adding the oil too slowly could make it thin, perhaps that’s what happened.

AskCulinary,"I always try to make a turkey as moist as the catering companies or restaurants but I never feel like I get 100% of the way there.  Their breast servings are always moist and flavorful but when I make it I always reach 1 or the other, but not both. Ie, it's moist but tastes a little watery (wet brine) or tasty but a bit dry (dry brine)

I think I have a 2 part problem.  My cooking doneness/timing and my carving.

I've tried a 2 day brine with water/salt/oranges/lemon/herbs and it's most, but tastes watery.  Tried dry brine with salt and herbs, and it's flavorful, but not moist enough.  

I cook usually until about 155 and let the carryover heat finish the breast to 165 (legs are about 185 doneness).  I""m always lazy so I get to the store late, and get a 15-25lb turkey (whatever's left). I've tried starting at 450 to brown the skin and finishing at 350, or just cooking at 350-375, or the last one I tried was pre-heat an oven with a baking steel at 450 and change to 300 when the turkey's in.

AskCulinary,"So I made a smoked brisket the other day, and first I would like to say thank you all for your help, you gave me a lot of good advice and my first smoked brisket turned out great. I had about an 8lb point that I Dry brined it for 24 hours before injecting it with beef broth, applying my rub, and slapping it on the big green egg. I started if off lo fairly low temp \~225 but it was difficult to maintain that low temp constantly. The advice on this reddit told me it was okay to go at higher temps because the lower temps come from offset smokers and this isn't one of those.  So I let the temp bump up and I tried to keep it between 250-300 F. Which meant sometimes letting the grill open to let some heat out. Total cook time was about 10 hours or so. When it got to the stall, I wrapped the meat in butcher paper but I don't know how much that did because I don't think I wrapped it very tight.  


[It was fucking delicious](https://imgur.com/7Tr6paS). The meat itself turned out super juicy and it was perfectly tender. However there was still a tiny problem I had with it and that was that I don't think the rub I made for it was super great. Now I tried using the rub from [this recipe](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/beef-and-bison-recipes/triple-c-beef-ribs-recipe) which is a rub featuring coffee, cocoa, ancho chilies, some brown sugar, and black pepper. I also occasionally sprayed down the brisket with \~66:33 mix of dark ale and apple cider vinegar. The rub turned out a little too wet, it wasn't all that crispy and also I think it just burned to much, I couldn't really pick up too many of the notes of coffee, cocoa or chili in it. So what do you think went wrong. Should I not have sprayed it? Should I have wrapped it tighter? Should I have used more sugar? Less sugar?

AskCulinary,"I’ve been experimenting with Chinese steamed black bean ribs (the type you get at dim sum). 

Some of the recipes recommend running the ribs under the faucet until they are pale to both tenderize the ribs and also get rid of the blood. 

Couple questions about this:
- alternate methods. Looking for other methods as it takes time and lots of water - I’m individually rinsing each riblet for at least 30 seconds. Would soaking the ribs in cold water draw the blood out?  What about taking a hand torch to the ends of the ribs - seems like the blood leeches out of there so could burning it seal the blood in?  

- what if I don’t do this?  I did notice that some blood still leaked out during cooking and it just coagulated at the end of the bone. Yeah it’s ugly and I just scraped it to the side. I could imagine if I had a sauce I wouldn’t want blood blobs floating it in - but is this just a cosmetic thing or would excess blood impact taste?

Tonight I’m hosting a family dinner (in Vegas people can’t get Christmas off so we always celebrate a day or two after).

Anyways I really want to make a beef Wellington, and I’m feeling like this might be too big a task to take on lol.

All the recipes say “it’s simpler than it seems” buuuuut I’m reading on here that it takes some like 6+ hours to make! Why? How? Is it because they’re making their own puff pastry? I definitely won’t be doing that.

Anyways, waiting for Costco to open to see if they even have the tenderloin in stock, but I have a few questions for the gifted culinary people of the world:

1. Would 3 or 4 pounds be enough for 9 people ?

2. Most recipes I’ve read says to put the Wellington in the refrigerator for 30 minutes after wrapping in puff and before baking. Is it okay if I prep this earlier and leave it in the fridge longer until I’m ready to bake it (Like 2 or 3 hours)? 

3. Speaking of the puff pastry... would I have to cut a 3 or 4 pounder in half and get two frozen puff pastry ?

So this morning my grandma started cooking our 9.8lb standing rib roast. The recipe she was following (which is for a 5lb roast) called for it to be cooked at 325°f for 1 1/2 hours. At that point it should be removed, coated with a mustard mixture and then cooked for another 1 hour.

Due to circumstances the roast was cooked for the first 1 1/2 hours, coated and then placed in the oven with the heat off.  This was all before 8am and the roast has been sitting in the oven ever since, it still hasn't completely cooled.

I'm trying to avoid potassium sorbate and citric acid to make them as clean as possible, but still shelf stable. I recently read you can use lemon / lime juice as a natural preservative... Will that work? How much would I need? 

Here's the recipe I'm using: 

3/4 cup cool water (or alternative dog-friendly liquid of your preference)

3 tbsp quality powdered gelatin

2 tbsp smooth beaut butter

2 tbsp boiling hot water

Making the Treats:
Measure the water into a small pan.
Sprinkle the surface with gelatin powder.
Wait and let sit for approximately five minutes or longer for the gelatin powder to bloom / gel. 
Gently stir the mixture over low heat until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Take care not to shortcut with high temperatures or overheat. Heat can reduce the setting strength of gelatin.   
Remove from heat. 
Measure your peanut butter into a suitable container for mixing and pouring. I’ve tried a variety of methods over the years, but nowadays, I like using a coffee milk jug when I make gummies.
Incrementally add small amounts of boiling hot water to the peanut butter, stirring it into the peanut butter until it melts together.
Add your warm prepared gelatin to the melted peanut butter mixture and stir to thoroughly combine.
Optional: To help avoid any lingering bits from settling and making it difficult to cleanly separate the gummies from the molds, you can allow the mixture to cool to just above its setting point before pouring into the moulds. Slowly, stirring often, allow the mixture to cool and thicken. You can do this at room temperature, or speed it up by using the fridge or an ice bath, if you prefer.
When the mixture has thickened enough, spoon/pour the finished gelatin mixture into a glass pan (cut and slice) or silicone moulds (shapes).

AskCulinary,"So, the stores here are closed. I am unexpectedly hosting a small Christmas feast tomorrow for my 2 roommates. I have 2 boxes of scalloped potatoes from the early COVID era when we were advised to have non perishables. I have a sack of potatoes, too.

I have never made potatoes from a box before. Many times from raw. How can I improve the boxed scalloped potatoes? 

I have: fresh potatoes, bacon, lemons, chard, fresh and dried herbs, fresh chives, onions, sour cream, cream cheese, broth, plain yogurt, loads of good cheese, some milk, etc. I don’t have enough milk to do it all from scratch.

Hi all,
Quick backstory: I'm 23 and due to covid, I'm having dinner with both my parents where as we usually go to see our extended family.

It is 3.75 inches at it's thickest. The methods of cooking I have at my disposal are stovetop, oven, or sous vide, but it may not fit into my gallon sized ziploc bag to sous vide. I am leaning towards reverse searing it, but any help will be greatly appreciated!

AskCulinary,"I'm experimenting with creating a mochi-like sweet without sweet gluttonous rice flour. I want that chewy soft doughy consistency. If I make regular dough from all purpose flour, that makes the right chewiness and softness. And if I heat up the flour before adding water it should kill all the bad germs, so eating the dough should be safe. But that feels a little like cheating.

I've messed with butter and coconut oil and adding too much of fat to flour ratio makes baking them turn out like buttery flour sand cookies. Adding too little turns them into hard rocks of solid bread. Undercooking the dough makes the outside crunchy and the inside chewy dough. I've experimented with eggs and cornstarch as binders, but I don't think I've come up with the right ratio to really make a different. Adding too much eggs makes it into a cake like bread. Adding even more egg makes german pancakes (custard like). Adding too much wheat gluten makes it chewy and tough with a strange almost bitter taste.

Is there a combination of all purpose flour, and other common ingredients, kneading / no kneading, steaming, microwave, convection oven, or other techniques or equipment. That will give me that mochi like, soft and chewy texture.

AskCulinary,"A part of my family tradition is to make a sort of deep fried shrimp ball. The item is a large butterflied shrimp (raw) with a pork mixture stuffed in the middle. 

Since my grandmother passed away we've been having issues getting the shrimp balls crispy. all of the recipes were done through eye balls and taste. I deep fry in a wok outside with a propane tank and use temperatures around 375. I don't think the batter was anything special, but there's something that just isn't working out. The skin should be crispy with a fluffy interior. I would expect it to be remain crispy for at least an hour.

What I would like to know

1) Tips or tricks to deep frying items such as these. The Batter is kicking our ass. Any recommendations to improve this would also be welcomed.

2) What exactly does the egg do to the batter? I played around with more eggs than water and the batter was pretty unsavory had a brittle texture like a cracker.

3) Sometimes when I wing it the batter has this bitter flavor, where is that coming from?

4) I've seen some videos that dredge items in flour, is this necessary or desired? I did not see any difference.

\-Duxelles tasted a bit too strong, any tips for this? Maybe it's just me but I would have liked a more delicate flavor, the Duxelles was really strong in taste. Can I add heavy cream? I also used whiskey, around 3 tablespoons, maybe that made it a bit bitter?

AskCulinary,"PSA drunk rant

Why do supermarket meats even exist? Ok, I get it, cheap and convenient. But I think most people these days are looking for good quality meat. Most meats in supermarkets are packaged and frozen and shipped to be thawed and maybe frozen again if you don't use all portions. I hate double freezing meat.

In our society (US), I really think we should bring back the traditional butcher shop for several reasons. 

1) Meat should be GOOD
2) Meat should be ordered by exactly what you want, or at least ordered from a selection of what is available 
3) Meat is a LUXURY. Specifically beef and pork. Yeah, i have a chicken/foul shop, but of you want finer cuts of finer meats don't settle, treat yourself to the best, but sparingly. Who but a rancher eats steaks and burgers everyday (societal norms aside but THATS THE POINT!)

* ▢1/2 cup unsalted butter room temp
* ▢3/4 cup white chocolate chips
* ▢1/2 cup crushed candy canes plus more for dipping
* ▢1 pinch salt

* ▢1 egg room temp
* **▢1/2 cup sugar plus 1 tbsp**
* ▢1/2 tsp vanilla extract

I bought a number of tenderloin steaks on sale a few weeks back and froze them, thawing them for this dinner. I love my sous vide, so I shaped them in wrap and held them in my SV @ 128° for 90 minutes.

I'm wondering though if I've created a potential food-safety hazard by not searing the beef. I don't think 90 minutes is long enough to pasteurize at 128°.

AskCulinary,"I currently have a massive whole brisket sitting in my fridge that I got from Costco. I'm trying to figure out what to do with. I've done many a Jewish-style braised brisket before but I also want to try smoking one for the first time. Now the brisket as-is, is too long to completely fit inside my big green egg (its just barely longer than the diameter) so I figured I'll cut it in half and then braise half and smoke the other half. This brings me to my first question: Is the flat or the point better for smoking? Typically I get flats for braising so I'm inclined to use the flat in my braise and the point in the smoker but I don't know if that's good. Then my second question is, for smoking, should I trim the fat or not? I've read conflicting reports, some people say to trim the fat because it will prevent the flavors of the smoke from penetrating the meat, others say to leave it on as a protective layer to prevent the meat from drying out. My goal for the smoked brisket is to half a juicy and tender falling apart brisket so I want this to be as moist as possible.

Then my next question: What are your favorite Smoked brisket recipes or tutorials. What should I know as a first-time smoker? What's your favorite brisket rub?

And my final question: As I've said before, I've made many braised briskets, but I'm still always interested in learning new recipes. What are some unique flavors and ingredients that you like to put in your braises? I'm typically a fan of bold, sweet, and fruity flavors with a fair amount of acidity that brightens up the palate.

AskCulinary,"I'm attempting to make cinnamon rolls for my little brother's birthday. I followed this recipe: [Homemade Cinnamon Rolls](https://tasty.co/article/hannahloewentheil/cinnamon-rolls-from-scratch-recipe-tips)

It states that i should:
""whisk together the warm milk, sugar, and melted butter. [...] Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed.""

I checked on my yeast mixture after 10 minutes, and the butter seemed to have created a viscous layer over the milk. I stirred it all together and poured the flour over it. I continued to follow the recipe and let my dough sit. One hour later, my dough is still the same size...

AskCulinary,"Any help is greatly appreciated!!!to make really soft marshmallows, but have them hold their shape.

We don't make S'mores, but we put them in hot cocoa and chocolate, so that is what I need them for.  
Plus, the kids like them softer.

Anyway, the recipe I use is:  
20 grams (0.7 oz) powdered gelatine  
100 millilitres (3.4 fl oz) cold water  
I let it bloom as you would normally let gelatine work.

200 grams (7 oz) granulated sugar  
100 millilitres (3.4 fl oz) cold water  
I cook this until it reaches soft-ball stage (113C or 235F).

I melt the bloomed gelatine over low heat, pour in the sugar syrup and whip for a few minutes, until it starts to turn white.

I have used a big, stand mixer and a hand-held electric mixer, and it's the same procedure - whip until it starts to turn white, turn up the speed, whip until thick, add vanilla, and beat for another minute, and by that time, it is almost tripled in volume.

I place it in a pan and leave it to set at room temperature.

Now, they are delicious, but quite firm (dense?) and chewy.  
I would like them softer, but for them to still hold their shape so I can cut them in squares.

I thought about how to approach this, but I am not an expert it confectioneries, so my only ideas were:  
a) use less gelatine  
b) cook sugar to a softer stage.

AskCulinary,"I've yet to find the best way to store and dispense honey. I know there is no way to avoid crystalization, so what I currently do is keep my bulk honey in a large mason jar that I will heat up in a pot should crystalization become noticable, and fill my pathetic, leaky plastic squeeze bottle when it runs low.

The only thing the plastic dispenser is good for is easy dispensing, otherwise I hate it. Often the crystalization will start happening in the plastic jar. I hate throwing that thing in a pot to warm it up. It just makes me feel uneasy...

I'm wondering what the BEST way to store and dispense honey would be, and I suppose I should note that 95% of my honey consumption is in my coffee and tea.

How do you guys deal with this first-world problem? I would think a mason jar/honeycomb stick would be a decent solution, except for the dispensing part... Sounds messy.

I've seen the dispensers that dispense from the bottom. Don't think that would work since you still need to warm the honey in a pot should crystalization begin. The best solution I've come up with is a large ""cut-off"" syrup dispenser. One large enough to throw in a pot should you need to. However, my experience with those things is that they gett pretty messy.

I put the cookies in the oven for 50 minutes and they just never... Combined?

Steps I took: 

1. Made brown butter, strained out the milk solids.
2. Cooled brown butter to room temp (previously) and cooled it further in the freezer. 
3. Creamed brown butter with sugar, salt, and rosemary until it was sandy using kitchenaid mixer
4. Added flour, mixed with kitchenaid mixer until combined, but not too combined.
Rolled, cut, and baked at 300F for 50 minutes... Then an additional 10...20 minutes with no change in consistency.

AskCulinary,"I am wondering what I am doing incorrectly.

I generally BBQ my Prime Rib, but a few months ago, I was injured and unable to go outside. I cooked my Prime Rib steaks in the frying pan with the exact same seasonings I normally use, to a level of doneness that seemed similar, and it wasn't very good. I assumed, I got a bad batch and moved on.

Now I have recovered, and was BBQing my steaks again, and they taste fine. But I had to use the pan earlier for one of them (horrible weather), and I got the same bad taste as a few months ago.

I can't really articulate the taste, but it's just not good - almost like the meat has turned. Is there something I need to do, or make sure of when cooking this steak in a pan? It's not something I want to do when I have a choice, but I think I need to do *something* differently indoors that I am missing.

AskCulinary,"Hi guys,

Due to Covid this year I am not spending Christmas with my family and thus am going to attempt cooking my first roast dinner. I can cook a little bit and enjoy doing so but have never done anything like this. 

I am doing a leg of lamb and I intend to slow cook it in the oven covered at about 150/300 degrees (fan oven) on top of some garlic, onion and rosemary. I'm going to poke garlic into the lamb itself as well to hopefully infuse. Then drizzle the lamb with a bit of olive oil after seasoning and add water/broth into the tray as a basis for the gravy I'm going to make.

Initially I was intending to do a leg of lamb that i would have cooked for 4-5 hours. However due to unforseen circumstances, I now have a 0.5 kg butterflied lamb leg and I am unsure how long to cook it to still get the desired, tender result.

I want half the length of the biscotti to be completely covered in chocolate, which means in order to dip them vertically I need a somewhat deep but narrow bowl, rather than the typical shallow bowl of a bain marie. I do have a pretty good bowl for that, but it is a) only about 5” wide and b) made of glass (I’m not sure it’s Pyrex but it was a piece in a glass mixing bowl set). My pot that I would simmer the water in is too wide to rest the glass bowl on top. But, it has a metal steamer insert that would hold the glass bowl quite easily, with venting around the side.

Can I rest the glass bowl in the metal steamer, and melt the chocolate that way (without the steamer lid)? Or is this risky because of the glass, or would the chocolate melt unevenly?

Here's the issue: I'm almost certain that I'm finding a 'fishy' taste to it. It's subtle. The slight fishiness is why I stopped using canola oil (I'm one of those 'fortunate' people who get that taste from canola oil). 

I'm wondering why my butter is tasting like this too. I read (here) that with canola it's because of the linolenic acid. Not sure why I'd be getting this taste from butter. 

I made a batch of butter caramels late last week, and, today, a batch of caramelized onions. Both had the very slight fish taste. I'm trying to figure out what to watch for. Do I need to avoid certain brands, or is any cow that's eaten forage rape a problem for me? Maybe it's something else?

Between whipping cream containing carrageenan and/or gellan gum and now my butter tasting of heated canola oil, I'm going to have to buy my own cow.

AskCulinary,"Evening all,

I'm the proud owner of 3 kilos of finest smoked, boned and rolled gammon which which I intend to turn into a ginger glazed ham over a lazy day in the kitchen tomorrow. Unfortunately I forgot to ask the butcher whether or not it needed soaking over-night as my recipe suggests, but which it turns out there are conflicting views on.

I have tried cutting a small piece off, cooking and tasting it. It is salty - but I would expect it to be!  I also happen to quite like salt.

Like the recipe says, I added the dry ingredients (flour was 15% protein manitoba) to my food processor (Magimix 4200, dough blade installed), pulsed to mix, added warm water and oil and ran the food processor for 1-2 minutes to incorporate. During that time, my food processor was struggling to mix and even got stuck once, but then suddenly got unstuck and easily worked through the whole dough which in the end was very soft, gooey and sticky and didn't ball up like in the recipe. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried to do the windowpane test, but it was tearing really easily, no success.

The dry ingredients alone already filled up the food processor to about two thirds capacity, so I'm sure I just overloaded it. I'd like to understand what might have happened though: Did the dough blade, due to lack of space, instead of kneading, cut through the dough and rupture the gluten? Also, I didn't measure my water temp, could it have been too warm? It definitely wasn't hot, I'd guess in the range of 40-50ºC (104-122ºF).

AskCulinary,"

So my grocery store has a section of proteins that are at the end of their shelf life or ugly for a discount. Recently I saw a small pack of “Organic Grass Fed Lamb Stew Meat” for like $4 so hell yeah. The problem is I have only cooked chops or eaten roast so now I have raw lamb nuggets and no direction.

The lamb meat looks very lean, darker as lamb tends to be but no marbling or excessive sinew leading me to believe it’s a loin or some tougher cut. I had the idea to chop it or mince it which guides me to lamb burger recipes. As stew meat I get a lot of middle eastern recipes, but lots use fruit which I’m not a big fan of. I snagged some lemongrass thinking I could do some indo-pan-Asian clusterfuck a la what I usually do for stir fry and soup.

What do you think, would it be better chopped small, can I roast like rarebit or do I need to add fat? The pieces are about 1” cubes.",Lamb Out of the Discount Bin (also posted in r/cooking),thistim,1608617342,2020-12-22 06:09:02
AskCulinary,"Hey everyone!

A few weeks back I bought some tuna steaks for the purpose of making poke (wild caught, brand called Anova). I wanted to know if this would be considered proper handling or if I should be on the lookout for possibly getting sick:

The fish came frozen, and I had kept it in the freezer ever since (standard refrigerator/freezer , not sure of the temperature inside freezer) . Yesterday, I took it out of the freezer, out of the vacuum pouch, and onto a plate (covered) in the fridge to defrost overnight. Today, once the tuna was completely defrosted sometime around noon, I marinated it and put it back in the fridge while I prepped side dishes (about 10 minutes). Then I served and we ate. 

Was this process considered correct or should I have done something differently? I had read online that you can defrost tuna quickly using a cold water bath,  but I was afraid of raising the temperature too much due to possible growth of harmful bacteria on the fish. 

I didn’t think much of it, but my sister is absolutely terrified of the possibility of getting infected with a parasite or possibly getting food poisoning. I thought it would have been safe since it was frozen for weeks, but her constant questions is starting to make me doubt.",Proper handling of Raw Tuna?,CoyoteDanger,1608617309,2020-12-22 06:08:29

I am wondering how should I cook my steak (beef).

For anyone not familiar what Entrecôte is, it's similar to ribeye but cut from the lower(on the cow) part of the ribs. [Wikipedia (30s read time, with pics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrec%C3%B4te)

I need to cook it for 4 people and I want it about medium/medium-rare. I thought I could do a weird way of reverse sear with it and put it in a 120C oven until it is the right temperature  (is 52C internal enough?) then rest it (for how long?) then cut into 4 steak-like pieces and sear it separately to develop a nice crust.

The next problem is, that I only have a cast iron skillet for 2 steaks at a time and I am afraid that the parts from the middle will be too wet to sear properly and the 1st batch may cool down too much while the 2nd batch cooks. I would baste it in garlic and thyme butter etc. all the good stuff.

The meat right now is in the shape of about 15x10x7cm if it makes any difference.

I could just reverse sear it normally but it would mean that 2 of us will get the inside parts which will be seared less and I know I can just cut all of them in half and divide them between us, although it does not look too good on the plate.

As for preparation I would salt it with about 0.5% salt by weight and leave it in the oven overnight normally, but as I would sear it later after the cuts it might be unnecessary.

I have an average thermometer with a long cord that I can leave in the oven.

&amp;#x200B;

Did you have any experience doing that or have any ideas?

AskCulinary,"Anyone have experience with pro meat slicers for thin cuts? Primarily for Chinese hotpot and pho. After a brief research, it seems all ""home"" ones are junk (e.g. ones from Amazon). The factors they suffer are: lack of power (e.g. need to pause every 10 seconds or risk overworking the motor--you can actually smell the motor burning), inconsistent cuts, blades that dull quickly, unhygienic (some parts are difficult/impossible to clean without dismantling the entire unit).

I'm prepared to spend a couple grand on a nice one if it is BIFL. Parts should be easily purchasable/replaceable--I assume the blades get inevitably dull over time and need replacement. It should also be popular and time-tested (not interested in one that works well within several years and breaks down requiring a full replacement).

I'm thinking of cutting a bunch of meat at once, freezing them and using the meats within 1-4 months. Does meat quality degrade in the freezer within that time or do they need to be vacuum-sealed?

My situation: I’m an art student (hence pretty close to zero culinary/confectionery experience!) in England wanting to send a package of Christmas gifts back to my family in the EU. Among these are the usual non-perishables as well as some handmade Christmas gifts. For one of these handmade gifts I wanted to include a palm-sized chocolate shaped like a cat head that I made. However, this was pretty much my first time “making” my own chocolate, and the internet can only take me so far. 

I did a couple test runs, the first one turned out softish and melty (scientific terminology), and crumbled when I tried to break it. Now I’ve discovered that it needs to be tempered, and I tried a tempering method in the microwave that I found online. I also put this last one in the freezer for a bit longer, but in the end it came out pretty solid. It’s snapping off very cleanly when I break it, but it’s still got condensation on it after an hour out the freezer, still leaving fingerprints when I touch it, and still getting a small layer of chocolate on my fingers after I lift them off.

I am not professionally trained, however, I have worked in many different types of restaurants (larger chain, mom/pop, mid level all from scratch). I love to cook and am finally realizing it’s probably the only thing I enjoy enough to not hate every day. There’s a little about me but onto the current situation. 

Currently, I am in is I am the lead line cook along with the owner of the restaurant. There is a couple people who work up front but that’s about it. He has a successful food truck and the restaurant he bought and converted was doing good before the pandemic hit. His menu is basic food truck type items: cheesesteak, fries, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I’ve been here for about two months, things are slow but we are making it work. I’ve implemented certain things to make quality better (shredding our own cheese, making prep sheets, helping improve current recipes). The restaurant we have used to be a pizza shop and the ovens came with the building, two stacked Zesto deck ovens. I said I love making pizza dough and we can experiment. I made the pizza, we now serve it Friday and Saturday nights in very limited quantities. (20 dough balls combined for both days). If you are curious about the pizza just let me know!

Since the holidays are coming up I am going to experiment with making a fried chicken sandwich that we can start as a special but hopefully be a new menu item, possibly the start to a menu change. Currently the chicken we use for the flat top is just chicken breasts sliced super thin. I was thinking of taking these same chicken breasts and possibly splitting/slicing portions into either halves or slicing into make shift tenders or both. My thought process is a fried chicken sandwich like Popeyes or chick-fil-a with the split breasts on a burger bun and then a tender type sandwich on Texas toast, similar to something you get at zaxbys and Rasin canes. I am going to brine in seasoned buttermilk for at least a day, now comes the part where I need some advice. We only have one fryer at the moment and limited space so hand battering might become difficult if higher volumes are achieved. Also, it’s an open fryer and not a pressure fryer, but I still want the most crisp and juicy chicken I can get. So for prep I was thinking of dredging all the chicken, frying once at a lower temperature 275F-300F. Draining them very well then either refrigerate or freeze them and fry at high temp 375F-400F for service. This I feel like would cut down on ticket time and also produce juicy and crispy chicken. 

Please let me know any in insight or tips any of you have! I’m super excited I found this community!","First post here, need some advice.",bverv,1608417160,2020-12-19 22:32:40

AskCulinary,"I'll be overnight shipping 9x6"" pans of lasagna to my family/friends in a few days. I'm currently cooking a 48 hour giardiniera, rolling out my pasta sheets, cooking my béchamel, and then assembling. In the past, I have not cooked my pasta sheets at all before assembling. They have always gotten cooked through quite well by the juices from the giardiniera. I've made this lasagna nearly 20 consecutive years! (it's the greatest recipe in the world, it's vegetarian, and I'm happy to share if anyone needs \*the best\* recipe.) 

This year, because there will be 24-48 hours between assembling and baking, I'm nervous about soggy noodles. I've thought about shipping the pieces separately with assembly instructions - I decided that it's important to me to ship it pre-assembled. I've thought about assembling and then freezing, which is probably my best bet to stop noodle sogginess, but I'm a bit concerned it could affect the texture? I've also thought about boiling the pasta sheets for 30-45 seconds and then dousing in cold water, and letting dry for \~an hour, \[possibly brushing very lightly with olive oil\], and then assembling and shipping un-frozen (they will be refrigerated for a few hours, and then carefully packed in a styrofoam shipping container surrounded by ice packs.) Lastly, I could of course just ship as-is and accept the noodles absorbing more flavor from the giardiniera, but potentially becoming a bit soggy.

AskCulinary,"Just bought this: [https://imgur.com/a/PA7xEjp](https://imgur.com/a/PA7xEjp) for xmas dinner (promised that the vacuum packing should keep it good until then!)

This is not a recipe request; more of a technique request.

I live in Germany, and while this one butcher has good quality meat, this purchase was a nightmare. In Berlin, people often point blank refuse to speak German with you if they get even a hint that it's not your main language. Problem is, they often don't speak English as well as they think. Case in point: he was convinced ""braise"" means ""roast"". And his French colleague falsely said UK and US cuts of beef are the same, then recommended a cut of beef called... ""roast beef.""

So my problem is: I want to make a roast, but their advice was not useful or relevant ; I couldn't do much research online as the US/UK cuts aren't available here; and the info that's online German is for German recipes, which are not what I want to cook. (They're great, but this is xmas, and it's about tradition).

This cut was called the ""entrecôte"". Here's a link to the German wiki so you can see where it's cut from here: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrec%C3%B4te](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrec%C3%B4te). They said this cut would be good for ""short roast"" (he said this in German, ""Kurzbraten"", short as in time) and that it should be ""pink"".

What I'm looking for: I want to keep it medium rare and prevent it drying out, but that might be difficult as it doesn't have the layer of fat you get on a sirloin. Other restriction:  the oven will generally be on 200°C for the vegetables, which I'd want to cook in the same roasting dish alongside the pigs in blankets.

I’ve been making fresh ravioli for quite some time in commercial kitchens with a lot of success.

AskCulinary,"Hi all, I’m about to make the fish stick from Blumenthal’s Heston at Home cookbook. Every recipe I’ve made from here including three of his other stocks have been absurdly good, but this one is giving me some hesitancy. Mostly because it’s a fish stock made in a pressure cooker.

Basically you clean and lightly toast the fish bones (I’m using sea bass) and heads in a pan, then in the pressure cooker you sautéed a bunch of veggies (carrot celery onion fennel tomatoes mushrooms garlic). Then deglaze with white wine and vermouth until pretty much gone, add the bones and water and then pressure cook for 15 minutes. Let it cool before removing the lid and then briefly simmer it for about 5 minutes with an herb blend, fennel seeds, saffron, lemon peel strips, and mussels. Strain.

To me this all sounds wonderful but the pressure cooker makes it sound like it’ll give me an absurdly overly pungent overcooked fishy stock. Even Kenji on serious eats said he tried to pressure cook a fish stock for 10 minutes and it was incredibly unpleasant.

I trust Heston as he hasn’t done me wrong yet, but this idea goes against everything I’ve ever learned about cooking. What would you all do? The same thing he suggests but with a stove top simmer? Or just go for the pressure cooker?

* Will it cost in the $50 USD range? Or if you know of such a toaster, a reasonable price, I'm not interested in $500+, but maybe I can search to the ends of the internet for a better price)
* I want an even toast, not just the parts that get heated from the spaced-out filaments, giving the bread the zebra look
* Maybe if the filaments are too close together they could cause a fire, I don't know. I'm curious because a grid would do a better job.
* I'm aware of some great toaster-**ovens**, but this needs to be popup.
* Maybe there's a better sub to ask this?

For those who missed my last post, husband and I were competing in making  a michelin-star level dinner. 

Competition parameters:

* Dinner for two, must be actually enjoyed by the cook as well, no spending all evening in the kitchen. (We did enjoy, but we were each exhausted by the end of the night)
* We each get a half day free from child duty that day
* Dinner will start around 8 when child is asleep (Both our meals lasted from about 7:30-10:30)
* We will be at a cottage that week, all groceries have to be purchased  ahead of time and brought with us. There is a grill and a fire pit  there. We can make as much stuff as we want ahead of time.
* Dishes have to be done along the way so we don't end up with hours of cleanup afterwards
* We will try to judge taste fairly together. Pictures will be shared

AskCulinary,"This is controversial. I’ve read a lot of posts that say in n out fries “suck” I’ve done research.

It seems to come down to

-different oil used (cottonseed) vs canola 

-different type of potato Kennebec potato vs russet

-different cooking method, no double frying and instead frying once 

-not flavorings because they’re natural unlike McDonald’s. 

-wanting the fries to be fresh so getting potatoes when they’re not in season 

But none of these really explain the dryness. I don’t think the flavor of the fry tastes bad at all. Sure they’re a little flat but nothing bad.

The reason people dislike them is they’re dry, and kind of brittle. They’re not crispy on the outside but also brittle, on the inside they’re not soft and potato-y and instead have their cardboard texture.

I read a post recently on the in n out sub that criticized OP and said it was because he has never had “real fries” because he’s so used to McDonald’s fake flavorings and fries.

AskCulinary,"Hi everyone,

I’m new to making garlic confit and I wanted to get some advice on garlic confit and botulism. From quite a number of things I’ve read on the subject (including reddit and other sources), some say that the main risk is using raw garlic in oil and other day that if you don’t heat the garlic up past 250F or 120C then it won’t kill the spores. Hence why people prefer pressure canning.

I was intending on baking the garlic confit either at 120C (250F) for 2 hours or 150C (302F) for approx. 1hr. Also intending on storing in sterilised jars and keeping it in the fridge.

That being said, I’m having a hard time finding good advice for cooking the goose. 

Methods I’ve seen:
- Roast goose whole with thermometer to check when goose is done. My concern here is overcooking the breast. 
- Roast goose whole but pull and carve off breasts when they reach desired temp and put the rest of the goose back in to continue cooking. Finish off the breasts and crisp skin on stovetop with reserved goose fat when ready to serve. My concern here is that doing this will make the breasts tough if there’s no resting time.
- Steam the goose before cooking (I think this is the Julia Child method?)
- Butcher the goose before cooking and do everything separate (sear breasts, confit legs, etc.) My concern here is that I’ve never butchered a raw goose. Is this terribly hard?

My wife and I face this problem when cooking chicken: sometimes our cooked chicken have that unique stink (I call it the protein stink, since it usually comes from chicken, eggs, beef, etc). It's typically prominent the next day after we heat leftovers but sometimes we can smell it the day of. 

In terms of quality, we try to buy the best chicken we can afford that the supermarket offers. We make sure it's as fresh as possible. We buy two different brands and both can have that stink so I know it's not the kind of chicken. We store it properly and make sure to freeze it before 'best by' date. 

In terms of preparation, we wash it, pat dry it, and season it well, before and during cooking. In order to combat that potential stink, we tried washing it with diluted vinegar. Didn't work. I thought it might be the fat but not sure. We do trim as much fat as we could.  (I'm not 100% sure but I think it's worse with breasts compared to thighs/legs).

In terms of cooking, we usually bake chicken but sometimes we pan fry it, sometimes both. We can still get that stink no matter how we cook it. I wish I can narrow it down and pin point when it happens and when it doesn't, exactly. The fact that we both get it when we cook, and we cook different things using different recipes/techniques, makes it more difficult to track.

I used the basic [Julia Child BB recipe](https://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/julia-childs-beef-bourguignon/cdda3ccc-3623-4363-8095-aaca1a3f8313).  
  
However, I separated the juice from the beef after about 2 hours of slow cooking, and stored them in the refrigerator, separately, overnight (point being to develop the flavors, and, allow for easy skimming of the fat layer).  The next evening, I reassembled everything, and slow cooked for another hour to bring the onions, mushrooms, and beef flavors all together.  
  
The beef (chuck stew) ended up being dry.  I had browned the meat on high heat (could have done more, but it at least was a little bit browned).  I have a feeling storing the beef separately caused this, but I am not sure.  
  
Additional question, is there a best practice to keep pearl onions from falling apart during cooking?  I initially slit the root end, boiled for 60 seconds, into ice bath, and then squeezed them out of the skin.  However, once they were sauteeing a few minutes, they started falling apart, and after being mixed together in the broader stew pot with the beef, they completely fell apart.  I was reading an X-slit on the root end is the way to go, but feel like this could still result in the layers coming out.  So, any detailed explanation how to prevent this is appreciated.

AskCulinary,"Tl;dr : looking for a good book about the philosophy and techniques of Cantonese home cooking (recipes only interesting for illustration purposes)

Lately I’ve found myself stir-frying “Chinese food” at least once or twice a week. Some of the recipes are Chinese-American cuisine, and some perhaps more authentically Chinese. A big source of the recipes I use are from thewoksoflife.com . I tend to gravitate towards Cantonese cuisine as my wife and I don’t like hot/spicy (as in Chili peppers) food. I want to enrich my background in the cuisine and techniques, but googling hasn’t found me a stand out text that isn’t “just” a recipe book. Ideally I’d like an overview of the techniques, ingredients, and philosophy behind the cuisine and not just recipes. A good example for what I’m looking for from a different cuisine would be “Washokou” by Elizabeth Andoh for Japanese home cooking.

AskCulinary,"Hello, very nice to meet all of you!

&amp;#x200B;

I came here because I had a few questions about changing my families' diet. I do 95% of the cooking and food preparation, and since quarantine, we have put on some pounds. I realize part of this is because I am really sick of eating what I fix and cooking certain things. I want to move our overall diet to healthier foods (not really to lose weight) but to be healthier in general. My five year old is very picky but I am hoping she would catch on.

&amp;#x200B;

We would eat a lot of potatoes, starchs, and some meats, and I would like to cut down on these things while still having a filling meal. I've never really cooked anything besides what you would call normal staples of food in certain areas (like mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets, etc) and want to really change our food entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

What cuisines should I look at? I am not the best cook, but I can follow directions. I was looking at Japanese cuisine since they do rice, and vegetables, but feel as if it's not sustainable and would be expensive, so I'm worried our grocery bill would skyrocket. That and it seems like it would take a very long time for each meal, which I'm not sure I have the time for. The same goes for a lot of healthier recipes I've found as far as pricing. How do you have a balance? I would really like to make healthy, filling meals that give my family choices and introduce them to new things, because I am tired of the kid's go-to being chicken nuggets and a lot of fatty things. I want them to make good choices when they are younger since I didn't have the choice to.","If I want to change our diet entirely, where do I start?",PlentyNaive,1608299827,2020-12-18 13:57:07
AskCulinary,"Hey folks! I'm picking up my prime rib in a few days for our holiday dinner, and I could use some input. I've had great success cooking individual steaks and other meats SV, but I want to know which method will produce the best end result for this roast. I'm not considering variables such as convenience or visual presentation - I want to know what is going to taste the best.

If I sous vide, I would probably cut the rib bones off and roast them separately. I'm thinking 132F/12 hours with a torch sear for the roast.

If oven, I would keep the bone on or tie back onto the roast, allow meat to dry in fridge for a day with salt, allow roast to come to temp before roasting at 200F until thermometer hits 120F, pull and rest, torch sear (or oven sear at 500F).

I know they aren't all the same:
- The callebaut crisp pearls are softer and closer to caramelized puffed rice.
- Crispy m&amp;m's are like a slightly crunchy rice puff with a malty flavour, there is also malt listed in the ingredients.
- Lindt crispy sensations are much harder almost like a biscuit or a honeycomb, they also contain corn flour and rice flour making them quite dense.

I'm curious as to how they are made. My mind is saying either a honeycomb type candy with riceflour/corn flour mixed in with the bicarb, or a biscuit high in sugar and with a boat load of chemical leavening?

AskCulinary,"Was watching the latest Claire Saffitz video where she makes a pecan brittle.  In the video, she adds baking soda to a wet caramel made with solely white sugar.

I understand the concept of adding baking soda to create a foaming effect and aerate the caramel (if you add enough you get honeycomb, etc.).  However, all recipes I’ve seen do this use some percentage of brown sugar in the caramel.  The idea being that the acidic molasses in brown sugar will react with the baking soda to produce the CO2 to aerate the caramel (this same reaction is important in many cookie recipes as well).

So... what is going on here?  People seem to say that a solution of white sugar in water might be slightly acidic, but it seems like not very acidic.  My only guess is that as the sugar decomposes during caramelization into all the flavorful compounds that make up caramel, some of these compounds are acid-forming.  Then the baking soda reacts with these byproducts.  Just my guess, can anyone shed light on this?",Acidity of caramel,avonBarksdale781,1608237569,2020-12-17 20:39:29

3/4 cups granulated sugar (5.3oz / 150g)

4 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 oz / 57g)

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour (6.1oz / 173g)

2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.22 oz / 6g)

1 teaspoon baking soda (0.21 oz / 6g)

2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, not quick-cooking (7 oz / 200g)

3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar (5.3 oz / 150g)

1 tablespoon vanilla extract

AskCulinary,"I keep struggling to find a method for roasting sweet potatoes that doesn’t leave them a mushy mess. Lately I’ve been trying the addition of a little cornstarch, but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping. In fact it feels like it’s making things worse - any brown that forms sticks to the pan rather than the rest of the potato slice. And recently I even managed to make oven fries with my trusty Yukon golds that were terrible - didn’t hold together at all! This is totally atypical for me and I can’t figure it out. I tend to be a good cook, pretty intuitive, and rarely use a recipe, but this has me stumped. I’m usually roasting in the 400-425 range, not convection, on sheet pans, grape seed oil, and with regular potatoes I’ll parboil first. 

Does anyone have a tried and true method for getting decent oven fries - particularly w sweet potatoes but also with other root veg, including regular potatoes - that isn’t super arduous? I don’t need them to taste or feel truly fried, just to hold together, gain a bit of browning/caramelization, and not be - as noted above - mushy messes.

Some problems I've encountered:

* To cover the rice I have to add way more water than I need due to the meat and carrot layers below the rice. The end result is mushy rice. I tried adding less water but the water quickly evaporates, leaving the top rice uncovered and uncooked.
* The rice falls through the carrot layer to the bottom, so to make a layer of rice on top I end up with way more rice than anything else.
* Meat gets overcooked due to needed to boil the water for the rice

All recipes seem to ask not to mix, but I'm not sure why. It would allow me to add less water, so I might try it. What do you all think?

All he said was he wanted something ""tropical"" (we're spending the weekend by the beach) so I decided on making a coconut cake with passionfruit curd filling and coconut-rum Swiss meringue buttercream frosting. 

My concerns are mostly over the buttercream. I planned on making Swiss meringue buttercream as usual, then adding in cream of coconut, coconut extract, and 2-3 tbsp of rum after I've mixed the butter in. Would this result in an overly liquid Swiss meringue or is there any other method I can use?

It's hard to get many ingredients where I live, so I can't use things like coconut powder- all I have been able to find is cream of coconut, coconut milk, and coconut extract. I was also thinking about maybe using only Malibu rum instead of the cream/extract/rum combo, but I'd rather avoid having to buy the whole bottle for only a few tbsp (but if this option would lead to significantly better results, I don't mind buying it).

Ingredients:
1 Cup chopped onions
1 cup rinsed red lentils 
1 clove of finely chopped garlic
1 TBSP of olive oil
4 cups of water or broth
1 teaspoon of cumin
1 tablespoon of curry or bullion 
1 teaspoon of salt

I slightly brown the onions and garlic in olive oil, then add the lentils and spices, then add 4 cups (7.75 cups the second time around) of hot water and bring to a boil. Then I boil for 30min.

When cooking it looks correct, a nice yellow/orange color. Once I remove it from the heat it's really thick, it's green-yellow, and it gets a skin really easily if left undisturbed.

AskCulinary,"So I'm looking at picking up a comal for someone as a gift. For those who don't know they're generally stovetop pans with a very low rim used for cooking tortillas and charring veg. This is the primary goal of the gift

The local Mexican markets all carry ~10"" carbon steel ones. I'm concerned these will generally heat unevenly and are truly only useful for tortillas.

Cast Iron griddles/comals seem to be available as well, but I'm concerned about them being both uni-taskers and heavy - discouraging use. Although I'm leaning towards one of these (perhaps 10"" for an 8"" electric burner?)

Then there's cast iron pizza stones/pizza pans which seem like they might be able to do the work of a comal as well as be useful for pizza making (which they do like to do and don't have a stone). My concern here is that they tend to run larger (14"" or so) and so won't be particularly usable on an 8"" burner for the purpose of being a comal. Also, they have to weigh a ton, which might discourage use.

AskCulinary,"Ho ho ho, fellow redditers,

My girlfriend and I've decided to each take upon us a Christmas dinner to cook for the other person. She'll be cooking on Christmas Eve and I will be on Christmas day. 

At first, I just wanted to cook a starter, main and a dessert, but my stupid brain decided that I want to one-up her as I think she will be doing those three. I would like to also include a amuse and a entremets(?). She is also vegetarian and beets are by far her favorite vegetable, so I had the idea to make beets the central theme of this dinner. So far I've come up with this:

***Amuse:***

Blini with cream cheese/goat cheese, pickled red/yellow beet and wasabi/horseradish.

&amp;#x200B;

***Starter***:

A beet soup. She also loves soup, so this one is a no-brainer for me. I've found three recipes, which interest me:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/4kr20d/roasted\_beet\_soup\_with\_garlic\_focaccia\_croutons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/4kr20d/roasted_beet_soup_with_garlic_focaccia_croutons/) \- Sounds and looks great;

[https://thepigandquill.com/roasted-beet-soup-with-garam-masala-green-garlic-cream/](https://thepigandquill.com/roasted-beet-soup-with-garam-masala-green-garlic-cream/) \-  also sounds and looks great;

Can't really decide between these three and I'm unable to knowledgeably say what would fit best in terms of flavors and richness.

***Inbetween/Entremet:***

I wanted to go for a salad and luckily my boy Kenji has this one covered. I'm planning on making this a small dose.

[https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/04/roasted-beet-salad-horseradish-creme-fraiche-pistachio-recipe.html](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/04/roasted-beet-salad-horseradish-creme-fraiche-pistachio-recipe.html)

***Main:***

A 'beet' Wellington has been something she has wanted to make/eat for a very long time, but somehow it never came to it. I kinda have to make this as a main, but was always a little bit intimidated as I was afraid to have the dough become watery and only being able to slice of a couple of good sliced from the middle parts of the beet. I came across this recipe though, which in my opinion eliminates both those issues:

[https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-wellington/](https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-wellington/)

At first I wanted to make the Australian Masterchef young prodigy child's beet wellington, but when I looked up the recipe I wanted to jump off a roof. It had like 50 steps and ingredients and techniques for which I don't even have the equipment. A no-go. 

I've also come across Gordon Ramsey's beet wellington, and I think that I'm going no take his gel recipe and put the following things on it:

\- Pickled yellow beet;

\- Beet chips/crisps;

\- Truffle oil;

\- Microgreens (If I can find any);

\- Horseradish.

I've also seen lots of recipes put a layer of spinach around the beet, **does anyone know why and what it adds to the dish?** I don't really see the charm of it. And **would the douxel of Gordon Ramsey's regular Beef Wellington dish (the youtube-video) be a good replacement for the one from Lazycatkitchen, or would it mess up some things?**

**For the jus/sauce** I haven't really been able to decide what I'm going to make. I've found about 100's sauces and jus' but I'm unsure what would taste good with this. **Help would be really appreciated!**

***Dessert***:

This is where I'm struggling the most. **Would something like a chocolate lava cake with beet in it taste good?** Or maybe **the cake with some beetjuice salted caramel sauce?** I'm not sure if it would bring anything to the table or even color the cake or sauce red. The most common thing I've found which involved beets were cakes, but I don't want to make a whole damn cake.

Maybe this: [https://simplebites.net/bringing-back-sunday-dinner-a-do-ahead-menu-chocolate-beet-molten-cakes/](https://simplebites.net/bringing-back-sunday-dinner-a-do-ahead-menu-chocolate-beet-molten-cakes/) ?

Really am struggling hard with the dessert.

&amp;#x200B;

**Would you guys think that his menu would work?** **Won't it be too heavy?** I'm planning on making ahead of time what I can and I believe that a couple of hours will pass while preparing, cooking and baking things during dinner so there is room for food in our tummies.

**Would roasting every beet I use, regardless if the recipe says to cook it or not, kenji-style, make difference to texture or taste in the recipes?** 

I've also come across **chioggia beets** in my local supermarket, if anyone knows a good idea with that, please let me know!
